The burden of studies, household work, work pressure, family responsibilities, traveling frequently, improper environment, and reasons can be plenty that may affect your sleep cycle. Here are some simple tips for a good night\u2019s sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Stay away from the screen</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The screen is very harmful to the eyes and sleep cycle as the brain interprets that it\u2019s still daytime. Prolonged exposure to harmful radiation will impact the body in a negative way bringing loads of health issues in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Use aromatherapy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blissful fragrances of aromatherapy in the form of diffuser oils, essential oils, mists, and bath oils are best for a blissful sleep. It helps to calm the nerves and induces sleep. Find out the essential oils that suit your taste amongst multiple options like rose, lavender, eucalyptus, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Have turmeric milk</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking a warm glass of turmeric milk is sure to induce some good sleep as milk and turmeric are great drinks to be taken at bedtime. For the elderly population who suffer from sleeplessness, this is especially recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Evening exercise</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercising during the evening helps in tiring and stressing the body which results in a better quality of sleep at night and more of deep sleep as studies have indicated. Go for an evening run or hit the gym for healthy sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Dim lights early</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dimming the lights early can prepare the body to go to sleep as compared to the one where you shut the light off suddenly and go to bed. Sleeplessness occurs when your body is not yet ready to sleep. Making a favorable environment will help in restful sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> Next time you struggle with poor sleep, keep in mind these points and follow them for a good night\u2019s sleep.</p>\n",

Like cereals, pulses must find their way into your diet and we list some easy ways to do so!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Curries</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pulses in Indian meals find their place as curries as complementary to staples such as rice and chapatti. The list of pulses as curries is endless. Chole, tadka, matar, channa, rajma, black-eyed peas, and moong are some common ones used as curries. When prepared with the best Indian masala, they taste heavenly!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Cutlets</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pulses can be made into cutlets to fill up the evening snack cravings. Try out beetroot peas cutlet, rajma cutlet, or urad dal cutlets along with some chopped veggies coated into bread crumbs. Season it with chat masala and ketchup for a wholesome snack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Shake</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A protein shake is a healthy drink that can be made at home using pulses mixed along with millets like ragi, jowar, and bajra. Roast the pulses and make them into powder form and have it as a post-workout shake with milk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Cooling beverage</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pulses like Bengal gram or chana can be made into a healthy beverage like sattu. Add salt and sugar along with a teaspoon of lemon juice and your wholesome drink is ready to nourish you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Sprouts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sprouts are a gem as they are rich in vitamin C and other nutrients are increased when pulses are soaked and sprouts are formed. Pulses retain their best nutrients as they are barely processed. Have it with fresh tomatoes, onions, and cucumber along with some lemon juice and salt and pepper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Pulses are rich in proteins and helpful nutrients that are the sole reason why many functions in the body could thrive. So take charge of your health and set your daily diet with these goodies.</p>\n",

Weight loss not only improves your overall health and reduces the risk of various diseases but also boosts your confidence. Let\u2019s get into the tips for weight loss that you would swear by!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Eat enough</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you one of those who restrict their diet to be slim and in shape? Well, that would not help you in the long run! Eating enough is important and you would realize it in the long run as your body starts to dysfunctional due to lack of nutrition. Try to eat a balanced diet and see the changes for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Train harder</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just diet won\u2019t help in weight loss. Proper training is important too. Be determined and take up exercise in any form as a habit like yoga, running, swimming, or Zumba. Hit the gym and let it motivate you to remain fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Connect with the community</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The importance of a like-minded community knows no bounds. Connect with the people who are going through the same phase and share tips and tricks within your circle. Also, it will help in boosting your morale and push you even harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Don\u2019t skip</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not skip your meals no matter what and so do training. Keep a track of your progress and be consistent in your efforts. This way you would be able to reach your target sooner. Skipping meals would only result in the accumulation of fats and weight in the future which would be harder to lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Have Patience</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weight loss journey can be easy for some while tough for others. Do not let the time take away your motivation. Stay motivated and have patience and respect the process as your true zeal and enthusiasm will help you reach your target sooner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Never give up!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving up is for losers and you sure aren\u2019t one! So stick to your journey and see the change in your body soon. Do not take the process as a forced one, rather enjoy it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> You can do it! Write to yourself some self-motivating quotes, take inspiration from success stories, and consult and seek guidance from experts and nutritionists for the best results, after all it\u2019s your body!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Coronavirus has brought the focus to sanitization and hygiene more than ever and as parents and guardians, it is vital to teaching your kids to take proper precautions and steps to a safer life, not just for coronavirus but as a means to good habits in general. For all the confused parents here we have a few guidelines to keep your kids safe and teach them hygiene practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Washing hands</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Washing hands has always been in the textbooks for as long as we can remember but now it is even more in the limelight. Kids should be aware of when to wash their hands, even when they are not around to monitor. Here are certain instances:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) Before and after eating</p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) After visiting the loo</p>\n\n\n\n<p>c) After handling pets</p>\n\n\n\n<p>d) After playing</p>\n\n\n\n<p>e) Touching anything dirty with an increased risk of illness</p>\n\n\n\n<p>f) After visiting outside</p>\n\n\n\n<p>g) After handling shoes</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Brushing teeth</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brushing teeth twice a day is good oral hygiene that every kid must follow to avoid cavity formation. Brushing after eating anything sticky or very sweet is also recommended. Cleanse your mouth and rinse after eating every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Using a handkerchief</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a handkerchief is good etiquette and hygiene practice. It must be taught to kids early on so that they stay neat and tidy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Avoid putting everything in your mouth</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kids have the tendency to put everything in their mouths, especially toys and household items. Make them aware that it is a bad practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. When to restrict sharing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing is a good sign of building good relationships and friends but in some cases, sharing can harm health especially if it bears the risk of infection. Try to teach your kids not to share the water bottles they sip in, or hanky, towels, and other personal items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Mask and sanitizer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using masks and sanitizers while stepping out is a common practice nowadays and it should continue as a means to prevent infections and illnesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you,</strong> Care for your kid\u2019s safety and health should bring into the focus teaching them to practice such practices while you are not around to monitor. Hence it is important to teach them to develop these hygiene practices as habits.</p>\n",

There is a lack of awareness amongst people regarding the nutrients that are beneficial for skin health. Taking care of skin health is important to look young and healthy.

It takes effort, support, and everyday motivation to set a track towards a life filled with positivity. Let\u2019s take a look at five simple ways to fill your life with positive energy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Practice Yoga</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga which has been around for ages has proven health benefits and fills the mind and body with positive energy.

Words of wisdom</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On waking up, try to recite some positive words every day or find yourself spiritually engaged with God and praying. Reciting positive words and words of wisdom helps in giving life a direction and fills you with motivation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Eat Healthily</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eating healthy including fiber-rich foods helps to keep the mind alert and sharp. It helps in overall growth and prevents illness and convalescence. So include loads of veggies, nuts, and cereals in your diet and keep fast food to a minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Pick up skills</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather a new skill that will help you in staying engaged and prevent negative thoughts and vibes. Try taking a new class, a hobby, or some team sport. Interacting with like-minded people also helps in bringing positivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Me time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take some time out of your busy schedule and pamper yourself into a spa or a beauty routine, a session of non-stop music, a cooking session, and loads of experimenting, or a calm evening with a cup of coffee, your favorite book, and nothing else!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next?</strong> Filling life with positive energy is very important for a healthy and prosperous life.

After all, who likes yellow stained teeth!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oral care should begin early, as early as a kid, and should continue religiously every day. Kids learn from elders so everyone in the family should be part of the ritual to take care of the teeth. Here are some simple tips for healthy and beautiful teeth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Avoid junk food</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Junk food is rich in fatty acids and materials that corrode the enamel. Avoid too many sweets and junk food to keep your teeth healthy and shiny. Junk food takes away the shine from the teeth and fills them with a bad odor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Eat more fiber</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fiber helps in keeping teeth strong and healthy. Add loads of fiber to your diet in the form of carrots, green vegetables, grains, and nuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Brush regularly</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brushing regularly and preventing cavities and other oral health issues. Follow up brushing with a good mouth wash to avoid bad odor and bacterial damage. Flossing once a week can also be done to keep food particles from sticking between teeth</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Say no to tobacco</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tobacco is dangerous for oral health and leads to cancer. It is best to avoid tobacco if you care for your teeth. If you find it difficult to leave, seek assistance when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you,</strong> Oral health is fairly easy to maintain if taken proper care of regularly. Try to manage time to take care of your oral health because your smile is priceless!</p>\n",

On it one side, kids need extra attention to health and well-being for proper growth and development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find these five ways in which you can take care of your kid for better health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Spend time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kids grow up differently as per the time parents spend with them. With limited outside exposure during covid, it is important for the family to spend time together and listen to their stories and outlook on life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Plan your meals</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning meals in advance not only saves you time and money but also takes good care of your and your family\u2019s health. Plan healthy meals after consulting with your pediatrician and nutritionist and leave out junk foods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Don\u2019t give into nagging</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kids are good at nagging. Don\u2019t try to give in to their nagging, try to be logical and reasonable while shopping out. They tend to be attracted to all the new products on shelves, and don\u2019t fulfill their demands easily. Look at what is best for their health before anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Screen out</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be strict while monitoring their screen time and fix a time schedule when they can handle gadgets. Over usage will lead to several health issues like eyesight and mental health problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Give space</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give space to your kids when needed as they require scope for growth and development. Kids love to spend some time alone doing what they love as it pulls them out from constant supervision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Follow these simple steps to take care of your kid\u2019s health and watch them grow into beautiful human beings.</p>\n",

Use less harsh ingredients<a></a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several harsh ingredients in cosmetics that are harmful to the skin. Make sure to read the label carefully before purchasing. The more soap a product contains, the more tendency it is to wipe off the protective fatty layer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Moisturize often</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moisturizer is important to replenish the skin with the lost moisturizer or due to frequent washing. Try to use good quality products as the skin needs care and proper attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.

Try keeping in mind some simple steps because it is important not to neglect some key factors that might affect health in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Keep spices down</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spices tend to heat up the body and make you feel hotter. Try to avoid spicy and rich foods and indulge in cooling foods. Spicy foods during summers may lead to several digestive issues too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Stay covered when out</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunstroke can be really harmful. Stay covered when going out with sunglasses, caps, umbrellas, hand shields, and scarves. Make sure not to let direct rays reach your eyes or head for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Wear comfortable</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comfortable clothing is key to tackling summers. Wear cotton clothes that are light and sweat friendly. Avoid heavy clothing or synthetic material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Hydrate often</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remind yourself to stay hydrated throughout the day with healthy drinks like sherbets, coolers, juices, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Don\u2019t forget the sunscreen</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunscreen is a must-have while tackling summers. Be sure to apply a good amount of sunscreen for at least 20 minutes before stepping out to stay protected from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Avoid carbonated beverages</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chilled carbonated drinks may be tempting but it is best to avoid carbonated beverages as they result in draining out even more. Instead of carbonated water, try to reach out for healthy natural drinks made out of herbs like mint and fruits like lemon, cucumber, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote</strong> Summer needs to be tackled carefully. Try following these simple steps to take better care of yourself during summers and stay chilled all season long.</p>\n",

Amaranth</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amaranth which is also known as Rajgira is rich in antioxidants while being gluten-free. Include it in your diet replacing wheat-based cereal as it is great when taken with milk. Prepare them into ladoos and add them as toppings to your meals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Potato</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Potato is gluten-free so you may include it in many forms like potato wedges, mashed potato cutlets, and recipes in ways that can be interesting to kids. But make sure to control your portion and not to include a huge amount as it is rich in carbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Quinoa</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quinoa is a superfood that is nutrient-dense that can easily be filling as well as replace your regular staple which is gluten-rich like wheat. Include it in the form of salad, or rice, or add it to your veggies. Kids love their colors so make sure to make it colorful with veggies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Chia</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that kids would love to indulge in which is undoubtedly healthy too is chia seeds. Include it as a healthy breakfast in the form of chia pudding, topping with berries, fruits, and nuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Corn</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corn or maize is a good gluten-free option however it is processed in a facility where wheat is also processed. So it is best to have corn in unprocessed form or store-bought. Prefer sweet corn, baby corn, or roasted corn with over-processed corn flakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Whenever you are in a dilemma about what to look for while searching for gluten-free options, grab on to the list we jotted down and watch your kids grow all strong and healthy.</p>\n",

While it\u2019s a critical time for newborns to adjust to the new world outside the mother\u2019s womb, it is also an important phase for mothers as they struggle with various bodily and mental issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little help can go a long way and thus, some of our tips for new moms can be a helping hand for every mom reading this!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Breasts need love</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the baby is born, the breastfeeding phase starts and it is a crucial phase for every mother-child relationship. Initially, breasts may seem swollen, heavy, and uncomfortable but keep in mind that it is where all the vital food for your baby is stored. Be gentle with your breasts and enjoy the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Saggy skin is okay</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phase of pregnancy has seen many changes in the mother\u2019s body as it prepared and carried a whole new organism. Once the baby is born, skin is bound to be saggy and it would take time to return to its original state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Be gentle</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is foolish to be harsh on yourself when you have won a war and given birth to a new living being. Try to be gentle with yourself and remind yourself of how special it is to be a mother. Try to talk to people and dedicate your time to something positive or engaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Everything takes time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything in nature has its own course of time, and so does this phase. Learn to be patient and calm even in tough situations. Focus on your physical and mental health and listen to some good music to calm your moods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Always seek personal or professional help whenever you feel you are struggling with this phase. Talk to new moms and learn about their struggles and winning stories.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Spinach? Out. Carrots? Out. Capsicum? Out. Peas? Out. Beetroot? Out. Bitter Gourd? Definitely Out! Such is the plight of a mother while dealing with a fussy eater. Kids are a struggle in themselves, more so when it comes to feeding them anything healthy. But it is important to tackle choosy eaters else it might result in nutritional deficiencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 5 ways to tackle choosy eaters,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Find alternatives</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your kid doesn\u2019t like a particular food, try to find an alternative way of cooking or preparing them like spinach if your kid doesn\u2019t like it as a vegetable, add them in the batter of dosa or make it into a smoothie. Make sure you don\u2019t deprive your kid of vital nutrients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Make them presentable</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to unpresentable meals, presentable meals attract kids and hence they consume them with enthusiasm and willingness. Make attractive figures like a bear, stars, moons, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Add colors</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having meals colorful and attractive makes kids involved and engrossed. It makes the task of feeding easier as they are involved in the process of eating and not distracted from it by means of television or smartphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Educate and involve them</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents who involve their kids in the kitchen during their early years have a greater tendency to have a better understanding of the benefits of food and the demarcation of healthy and unhealthy foods. It is easier to explain to them the merits of a particular food they feel like avoiding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Be persistent</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t give up easily to your kid&#8217;s nagging. Be persistent in your approach and try to find ways to make them accept the specific food they love avoiding so much. It&#8217;s always wise to focus on your child\u2019s health before anything else as their growth and development depend on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Tackling fussy and choosy eaters can be very challenging. Follow these simple steps and make sure not to compromise on your baby\u2019s health while they rant about how they hate having those bites of capsicum.</p>\n",

Choose snacks wisely</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than binge eating unhealthy snacks during work, try to keep healthy snacks and food around. Instead of grabbing unhealthy junk snacks, try to keep healthy options like nuts, granola, veggie sticks, roasted pulses, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Walkaround</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take time to get up from your seat and move around once in a while. Also, move your eyes away from the screen and move eye muscles often. Stretch whenever required and find ways to stay active amidst the sedentary life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Remember to hydrate</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often while working you might forget to drink sufficient water. Make sure to have enough water throughout the day. It helps you to concentrate better and stay refreshed. Opt for healthy beverages instead of colas and coffee every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Working all day in front of <a></a>the screen can be taxing and the sedentary lifestyle along with it is bound to gain a few pounds. Follow these simple steps and prioritize your health while keeping in mind the adverse effects of a sedentary lifestyle on the body.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Still, stuck with your same old regular sports drink which seldom does any good to the body? It&#8217;s time to rethink and try your own healthy drinks and reap far more benefits out of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sports drinks are usually rich in artificial colors and additives with little mineral content. Instead of it, try these 5 simple recipes that serve as a great pre as well as post-workout drink!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Ragi shake</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This serves as a great drink during workouts and sports activities. Ragi is rich in calcium and minerals essential for bone health. Together with milk as a shake, it serves as a good source of energy to keep you going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a></a><strong>2. Mint chia coconut cooler</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tender coconut water is rich in natural electrolytes which helps in replenishing electrolytes lost during sports activities or workouts. Paired with mint and chia seeds, it serves as a cooler rich in vitamins and minerals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Pomegranate punch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pomegranate is rich in antioxidants and counters the free radicals in the body. Many sports drinks available in the market are pomegranate flavored. It&#8217;s better to try out real pomegranate juice rich in vitamins and minerals. It is great for the circulatory system as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Turmeric latte</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cool turmeric latte is a soothing drink rich in protein, antioxidants, and healing elements. It helps to nourish as well as replenish. Have a cup of cool turmeric latte and ditch the store-bought sodas and unhealthy beverages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Cucumber mint cooler</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cucumber is the best answer to a hard, sweaty session of the game. It is crunchy, refreshing, and loaded with water. Coupled with mint, this serves as an extremely refreshing drink after a hot game or run under the sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote</strong> Next time you pour out your money on stacks filled with colorful energy drinks, think twice for you can relish far more nutritious and healthy drinks by preparing them at home.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>The end of winters and the start of spring is a tricky time for skin health. With the change in season, a series of complications arise.It is important to change skincare with the change in season to keep skin healthy. Often the use of improper products, harsh soaps, taking too many hot showers rips the skin off its moisture and turns it dry and flaky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some remedies to deal with dry skin in these changing weather conditions!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Coconut oil</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coconut oil has no bounds when it comes to benefits on the skin. It is a natural moisturizer that keeps the skin soft and supple. It has many medical and therapeutic benefits too and serves as a great massaging option. Take time and massage your skin before bath.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Vitamin C</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis and maintaining skin health. It is a natural antioxidant that protects the skin from harmful radicals. Be sure to use vitamin C serum or any products with vitamin c as an ingredient. Continue using it throughout the winter and spring season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Lock Moisturizer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moisturizer if not properly locked does little benefit to the skin. In the dry season, skin is even more prone to lose out moisture. Try to out in lotion or cream while the skin is damp so that moisture doesn&#8217;t lose out easily. Be sure to choose the right kind of moisturizer as per skin type and season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Night care</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A night care routine is very important as during sleep skin needs to relax and be nourished as well. Apply oil or lotion on cracked heels, elbows, knees, and other areas where it is more prone to get dry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote</strong> Try these simple steps to beat the weather blues on the skin and revert skin damage in a natural way. Be careful while adjusting to this change in season and enjoy spring to the fullest!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Stress and Weight is highly related, despite having every step to tackle to manage both. Stress can manifest in the form of weight loss or weight gain but stress-induced eating is far more common which eventually leads to weight gain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the ways in which you can manage the link between stress and weight gain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Move thy muscles</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most effective ways to manage weight gain and stress is by exercising. Working out and exercising releases a feel-good hormone that reduces stress. Also, it helps in burning calories and building muscle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Avoid strict diets</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strict and restricted diets often lead to opposite effects by ending up binge eating. The tendency to reward oneself for following a strict diet often leads to weight gain. The stress levels associated with strict diets are also more. Be sure to follow a balanced diet and not restrict yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Careful during meal times</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take care of the portion size during meals. Avoid overindulging in a particular type of food, especially calorie-dense food. Often junk foods and calorie-rich desserts release the feel-good hormone which gives the feeling of reducing stress but eventually impacts health in a negative way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Caffeine</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caffeine at breakfast is an unhealthy practice as it may momentarily give the feeling of reducing stress but it impacts metabolism and digestion. It eventually results in reduced absorption of nutrients, especially Vitamin A and C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Keep at a distance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stress-induced eating is common. Whenever you feel like binging, keep at the same distance from all the unhealthy foods and opt for healthier snacks and treats. Keep foods that manage stress as well as weight like oats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote</strong> Be careful of stress-induced eating and opt for healthy options whenever you feel like binging. Follow these steps and tackle both weight and stress at the same.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Gaining weight may seem simple but can be really a task for many lean souls desiring to bulk up. One must be familiar with the ways in which one can attain a healthy weight which is not only rewarding to the health but also is sustainable at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following is the checklist for a healthy weight gain!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Set up a goal</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up a goal is very vital in achieving a target. Make sure to plan out your goal step by step and divide your targets in an orderly manner. It is important to take guidance from experienced professionals at this point so that you are on a right track. Don\u2019t forget to let your loved ones motivate you too!<a></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Assess your calorie requirements</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calorie estimation is very important to plan out a proper diet chart. Make sure to assess your daily requirements and focus on a small goal at a time. Understanding RDA is also crucial in planning out your meals. Be careful not to indulge in unhealthy sources just to meet the calorie requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Avoid overeating</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overeating can be disastrous and will result in an increase in weight unevenly and lead to the risk of several health hazards. Avoid overeating and instead, plan out meals in different frequencies. Eat calorie-dense foods and prepare meals that are balanced and nutritious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Don\u2019t neglect exercise</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While everyone might say exercise is for the ones trying to lose weight, exercise is actually for everyone. People aiming to improve or increase weight need to indulge in light to moderate exercise to have better digestibility and absorption. Exercise will along increase hunger and thus result in better food consumption capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Sustainable approach</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what, be sure to adopt a sustainable approach. Look for ways in which a long-term benefit can be seen and not just a short-term gimmick. Look for naturally occurring calorie-dense foods like bananas and full-fat milk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote:</strong> Gaining weight can be demanding for many but the right guidance and approach can go a long way in bringing positive results. Seek love and support from your near and dear ones and embark on the journey which makes you feel the best!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Losing weight for some can be tougher than others. While there are many factors that govern an increase in weight and losing it, often it is harder than it seems. Genetic predisposition, change in lifestyle, postpartum weight can be a few of the many conditions leading to overweight. But for many who ends up gaining weight by unhealthy food and lifestyle choices can lose weight by focusing on a few simple points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a list of small changes that can help you lose weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Don\u2019t skip breakfast</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many embarking on losing weight end up starving and skipping meals. It is a wrong approach as it will only harm the body. Eat a well-balanced breakfast and include colorful fruits and veggies. Be sure to include complex carbs and fiber-rich foods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Stay hydrated throughout</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydration is very important to keep all the body processes running. Have a sufficient amount of water throughout the day and be careful not to indulge in unhealthy, sugary drinks and carbonated beverages while thirsty. They are loaded with sweeteners and empty calories. Instead opt for low-calorie healthy drinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Mindful of sugar and starch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skip sugar and starch when you can. Try alternatives to white table sugar and include natural alternatives like honey, jaggery instead. Avoid refined and starchy foods and be mindful while consuming packaged foods rich in fats, sugar, and salts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Protein has the power</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protein is vital in building strong muscles and thus strengthening the body. Increase protein intake and focus on exercise. Include good amounts of legumes, eggs, milk, and nuts in your daily diet but be sure of the fat content. Couple it with a good exercise regimen and have proper pre and post-workout meals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Consistency is the key</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what you embark on, consistency is the key. Exercise regularly as consistency will bear true results. Pair nutrition and exercise along with little lifestyle changes for a fitter body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote:</strong> Gaining weight may be easy for some due to <a></a>an unhealthy lifestyle but losing it and getting back to a healthier lifestyle that is consistent and continuous can be challenging. Be sure to be consistent in your approach and have patience throughout.</p>\n",

There is no uniform requirement for an athlete as every one of them is built differently with different requirements.The requirements of every individual athlete are different as per their sport, body structure, goals, training, etc. Thus a tailor-made diet concerning sports nutrition is key to optimum health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some nutritional tips that every athlete can follow:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Don\u2019t begin empty</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t begin training on an empty stomach or while being dehydrated. This will affect your performance. Try to avoid fasting and focus on a good diet that suits your regimen. Many who skip their meals, especially breakfast, soon run out of capacity and it strains the body even further. Be sure to have meals on time.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Plan in advance</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to plan meals well in advance which suit your training and routine. The power of diet planning and nutrition is very important as it will enhance endurance and capacity and aid in better performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Healthy calories</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose healthy calories always. Calories are not bad as you need sufficient energy to train hard. Be sure to opt for good quality sources of carbohydrates and proteins as a part of your meals. Including a good amount of complex carbs is a good way to supply healthy calories.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Power of protein</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Protein is important for every athlete focusing on muscle building and strength. However excess protein needs to be avoided. Focus on the amino acids that are crucial for your goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fruity friends</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Fruits are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Have seasonal and fresh fruits every day. Instead of indulging in packaged snacks, have fruits which is a very healthy option to meet mindless hunger as well as nutrient requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Healthy drinks</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many athletes rely on sports drinks and energy drinks. But most often they are loaded with very few percentages of fruit content and more of additives and sugars. Be careful to read <a></a>labels before relying on them. Look for alternatives in vegetable juices and smoothies that can be easily prepared at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you:</strong> Staying in shape and form is very crucial for every athlete to stay at the top of the game. Sport and nutrition should go hand in hand to yield optimum results. No matter what your game is, these nutrition tips are sure to keep you healthy and fit!</p>\n",

While there are many reasons for weight gain, it is essential to look out for causes to determine the intervention better. Early intervention is essential to avoid health complications related to being overweight which might result in a medical emergency too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some of the reasons for sudden weight gain might include:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Hormonal Changes</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Hormonal changes due to any underlying conditions or lifestyle may end up manifesting as weight gain. Stress-induced hormonal changes result in poor eating habits and may take a toll on overall health as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Pregnancy</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Pregnancy proactively results in weight gain as the requirement of pregnant mothers shoots up to meet both the needs of the mother as well as the growing fetus. It is generally not a matter of concern unless some underlying issues are manifested.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Menstruation</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight gain during menstruation is common in women. Women may face bloating and water retention along with hormonal changes which makes the tummy look bulged. Several women end up binge-eating due to cravings during PMS as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fluid retention</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An increase in body weight due to fluid retention is quite common, especially for individuals under certain causative medications kidney and heart problems. It is important to seek medical assistance for proper guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Side effects</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Several medications have side effects manifested as weight gain. Be sure to read instructions, dosage, and consult an expert before embarking on new medications. Often food and a drug interaction may also result in such side effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><strong>Some suggested solutions include</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Practice stress-relieving activities like yoga, medications, and exercises which help in tackling stress-induced weight gain. It also improves body flexibility and improves physical health.</li><li>Control portions and frequency of meals as it helps in distributing energy and puts less stress on the body to metabolize it. Pay attention to the source and seek healthier alternatives.</li><li>Take medications as prescribed by the doctor to tackle hormonal imbalances. Often side effects go if medications are altered.</li><li>Seek the help of a doctor for any weight gain resulting from underlying conditions. In case of rapid change in weight within a short period be sure to get yourself diagnosed.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you:</strong> Several reasons may end up as unexpected weight gain as every individual and their body structure is different. Be aware of your body and look for causes if any sudden change is noticed. Don\u2019t shy away from seeking the help of doctors and nutritionists.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>There are certain food groups that reap maximum benefits when eaten raw like fruits and some food groups which must be well cooked to prevent infection and pathogenic diseases like meat and dairy items. Cooking often results in nutrient loss but is essential for better absorption and digestibility and also to prevent illnesses. However, there are certain tips if followed while preparing meals can lead to minimal nutrient loss and thus reap optimal benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Follow a set cooking time</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooking time and temperature is crucial to avoid nutrient disintegration and also to make food safer for consumption. Beyond a certain time and temperature, degradation of nutrients may take place and also denaturation of proteins. Cook for a minimum of 65 degrees for veg items and 75 degrees for non-veg items.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Have fruits and vegetables with peals</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Having fruits and vegetables with peels help in retaining the nutrients and also protect them from environmental degradation. The peels supply soluble and insoluble fibers which are also prebiotic.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Store appropriately</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Storing food at an appropriate temperature is very important to retain the nutrients of the food. Avoid cutting fruits and vegetables and storing them as they will result in nutrient loss. Perishable food items like flesh and dairy items require extra attention and storage conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Choose cooking methods wisely</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various methods to cook foods like saut\u00e9ing, boiling, deep-frying, roasting. Baking, etc. It is useful to choose the correct method of cooking to retain maximum nutrients. Boiling and baking retain more nutrients than deep-frying. Opt for saut\u00e9ing over deep-frying to retain maximum benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Don\u2019t wash fruits and vegetables after cutting.</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It will result in the loss of water-soluble nutrients if foods like fruits and vegetables are washed after cutting. The same goes for washing grains too many times. Try to wash fruits and vegetables well with their peels on to avoid nutrient loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote</strong> Every health-conscious individual seeks maximum nutrients with minimal nutrient loss while preparing meals, which should be a common goal. However, oftentimes while looking for taste we compromise on nutrients. It is important to know about basic ways in which you can get maximum benefits while preparing meals and these simple tips will surely help!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Postpartum is a challenging phase for all mothers, and more so for new mothers. As much as the pregnancy brings forth the excitement of being a mother, the phase after giving birth while the body adjusts back to the pre-pregnancy state is a challenging one as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this phase of adjustment, mothers face many issues, like</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>postpartum depression,</li><li>stretch marks,</li><li>hair loss,</li><li>body image issues,</li><li>hormonal misbalances,</li><li>mood swings,</li><li>irregular routine</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips for new moms!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a list of tips for new moms to deal with the postpartum phase</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Stay positive</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A positive outlook and mindset solve most of the problems of this phase. Since it is a phase of transformation, mood swings, body image issues, and stretch marks are bound to happen. Take it as a part of the process and spend your thoughts and energy taking care of your body and your child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Practice yoga and meditation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercising routinely along with yoga and meditation not only tackles the body but also the mental health. It helps in instilling calmness and positivity. Take some me-time and practice something you love which will help you to stay focused and calm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Focus on diet</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take proper meals at proper times along with breastfeeding. Be careful not to overindulge in addictive foods and foods that are rich in caffeine. Seek the assistance of a nutritionist who can plan what is best for you and your child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Rest adequately</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It gets tiring dealing with a newborn and you are always extra careful protecting your baby. Be sure not to neglect your health as you require adequate sleep amidst breastfeeding your baby and changing their diapers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Speak to other moms</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing better than reaching out to other moms who are in the same phase or have been already in the phase. You may come across some vital tips and stories that will surely help. Also, it is important to seek a support system from your partner, friends,<a></a> and family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you:</strong> Since after-birth is a vital phase as much as pregnancy, it is important not to neglect yourself while devoting everything to the newborn. Believe in yourself and uplift your spirits with the love and success of being a mother- after all, you have always been a fighter!</p>\n",

Power Yoga</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your body reap the benefits of the age-old tradition of meditation and yoga by committing at least 15-20 min each day. The goodness of exercise and yoga does wonders to your mind and body and takes care of your digestive health too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Skincare pampering</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What better way to pamper yourself than to go for proper skincare! Follow the basic CTM routine every day and decide on your favorite facial masks for the weekend! Put on homemade packs or book an appointment at the salon for a relaxing time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Therapeutic activity</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be it cooking, gardening, crafting, painting, knitting, or journaling, take up your favorite activity that acts as therapy and just engage yourself in some positivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Treat Yourself</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treat yourself anything you love, be it a full brunch platter or a tasty munch! It works as a great mood uplifter as well. Go on a self-date or bring your goodies at home while watching your favorite movie or show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You:</strong> While taking care of everyone around, we often neglect ourselves.

Postpartum depression and facing body issues is one of the major ones. Here are simple tips to maintain a positive body image during postpartum.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Remember weight gain is normal</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As the body prepares itself to carry a child within, every change in the body is in favor of the fetus, including weight gain. What may seem a body image issue is actually the thing that giving birth made possible. After childbirth body magically does not return to the previous state at once. So be patient as it is a normal process.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Stop comparing</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Every bodytype and every new mother is different. Although insecurities about self-image may creep in when you chance upon a leaner mother, avoid comparing and focus on breastfeeding and taking care instead. Be confident and avoid negative thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Wear comfortable clothes</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after pregnancy, do not be adamant to fit into your old clothes. Wear loose and comfortable clothes which are breathable. Avoid wearing tight clothes with elastics as it will be torture to yourself unnecessarily.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Don\u2019t be hard on yourself</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As you would care for your newborn, care for yourself too. It surely gets hard with added tasks, breastfeeding, and sleepless nights but it is all worth it in the end. Be gentle on yourself as you require as much love, support, and strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Focus on diet and exercise</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many new mothers follow crash diets and weight loss programs soon after giving birth. It is important to understand that you are in a lactating phase so a proper diet meeting the recommended requirements is crucial along with an exercise pattern that is not too aggressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an obvious thing that pregnancy and childbirth will bring forth new challenges, but it is important to maintain a positive mindset and to love your body throughout, it is a temporary phase and your body will be back to how you desire in no time. Talk to someone you love and don\u2019t shy away from seeking support when needed.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Inculcating good habits and healthy practices in kids from an early age goes a long way. It helps in developing strong and intelligent adults who understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle, and thus protect themselves from diseases and health complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than nagging and doing correct things for them, try to teach them in a way that they perform healthy habits by themselves without telling them every time. Such <strong>behavioral change</strong> is crucial in developing healthy and wise individuals. But it is extremely important for parents to take the proper approach in building those changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a known fact that dealing with kids is no easy task, more so if you wish to pull them off from addictive, unhealthy habits into healthy ones. But we list down some simple approaches you can adopt in fostering healthy eating habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Washing hands before eating</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the increasing awareness during Covid about the importance of washing hands in combating illness, more and more people are adopting it as a part of their regular habit. Try to teach your kids to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water for a minimum of 20 sec, especially before eating. Give them a demonstration and explain interestingly how not washing hands can make them sick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Teach them about portion sizes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is extremely important to teach portion size to kids to prevent several lifestyle disorders associated with overeating. It can help prevent obesity, eating disorders, indigestion, gas, bloating, and many other digestive issues. Teach them to read food labels and the importance of serving sizes and self-control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Encourage chewing and track eating time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kids often become slow eaters taking long hours to finish meals or are too quick. It has adverse effects as too slow or too fast consumption of meals will lead to poor absorption of nutrients. Many kids end up gulping food with water to finish food quickly or to get done with boring foods which is a very bad practice. It is important to chew well and take appropriate time in finishing meals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Discourage multitasking while eating</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a bad practice to watch TV or to use a phone or multitask while eating as it can directly lead to poor eye health and obesity. As parents try not to follow it and instead take measures to focus them on food alone. Eat together as a family at a properly designated area meant for eating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Make them know the difference</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing will be feasible in the long run unless they have hands-on experience on the difference between healthy and unhealthy practices. Involve them in the kitchen and teach them with examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you:</strong> Once you know how to approach your kids to inculcate healthy changes, the tasks get pretty simple. It is important to have patience and to take time in understanding your kid as every kid is different with different mannerisms. Overmore, try to set a good example by practicing healthy habits as parents since kids tend to watch and learn most of the things.<a></a> Adopt these simple techniques and go on to become a perfect and healthy family!</p>\n",

Covid-19 has posed serious challenges in several ways and in a time like this, going back to the roots and embracing the benefits of natural foods can be extremely beneficial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holistic and sustainable care incorporates all the domains of wellbeing- be it physical, mental, social, or spiritual. Here are some simple home remedies and AYUSH-based holistic acre during Covid-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Frequent intake of <strong>lukewarm water</strong>. Boiling water before consumption helps in killing microbes and consuming lukewarm water is good for the throat as well for the digestive system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>HaldiDoodh</strong>&#8211; turmeric latte, a contemporary name given to our age-old turmeric milk is consuming half tsp. of turmeric powder or raw turmeric in a cup of hot milk once or twice a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong> should be thoroughly washed and cleaned. Preferring organic and naturally grown fresh fruits and vegetables should be the practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Gargling</strong> with warm water with a pinch of salt and turmeric should be regularly done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>Spices</strong> like turmeric ( Haldi ), dry ginger (saunth), coriander (dhania), garlic (lahsun), cumin (jeera), and others that have medicinal properties should be used in cooking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. <strong>Oil pulling</strong>&#8211; use 1 tbsp. of sesame or coconut oil and swish in the mouth (do not consume) for 2-3 minutes and spit it off followed by a warm water rinse. Proper tongue cleaning with a copper tongue cleaner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. <strong>Nasal application</strong> of 1-2 drops of coconut oil or sesame oil in each nostril two times a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. <strong>Steam inhalation</strong> with plain water or with pudina (mint), ajwain (caraway seeds) once a day to clear nasal passage. Be sure not to overdo it as it will lead to cell damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. Consume <strong>Amla</strong> (Indian gooseberry) and other fruits rich in vitamin c.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. Adopting <strong>yoga</strong> as a part of daily routine and practicing yoga asanas, meditation along with a proper sleep cycle should be practiced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote:</strong> These simple guidelines if followed on a daily basis will help not only prevent infections and seasonal illness but also bring out a positive approach towards life. It is important not to rely too much on heavy drugs on a daily basis and junk foods, but to find a way back to the roots and live healthily.</p>\n",

Our gut contains hundreds of good bacteria and microbes which constitute the microbiota and its composition varies from person to person. These microbes are responsible for better digestion and absorption of nutrients. They release many enzymes and acids which have many health benefits and are crucial for our wellbeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some easy homemade recipes to take care of gut health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Fruity Overnight Oats<a></a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This recipe works wonders for the gut and is fairly pretty simple to prepare.

Kimchi chicken rice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kimchi is a fermented dish originally from Korea which is known to be extremely good for the gut. Have it at lunch as a side dish pickle every day or toss it with a bowl of rice and cooked chicken for a flavorful meal. The process of fermentation releases short-chain fatty acids and helps in the proliferation of good bacteria. It aids in overall better digestive health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.

      "rendered": "\n<p>It is no hidden fact that childhood obesity is on the rise as there has been a rapid shift in lifestyle and food habits in recent years. A growing number of the younger population, especially the school-goers, are joining the bandwagon of overweight and obesity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents need to notice the change and take early steps in combating obesity as it puts them at a higher risk of several related disorders like diabetes and CVD. To understand how to tackle it, it is important to take a look at the <strong>possible causes</strong> that lead to obesity.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Sedentary lifestyle</li><li>Lack of outdoor activities</li><li>Pressure of studies</li><li>Eating unhealthy junk food</li><li>Overeating</li><li>Increased screen time</li><li>Frequently eating out</li><li>Lack of proper knowledge</li><li>Improper sleep and meal timings</li><li>Genetic factors</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you can tackle childhood obesity and prevent it to progress into adulthood,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Refer to the growth chart</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to know the recommended weight for a particular age group and height. Follow the guidelines of WHO and identify early if your child falls beyond the normal range. Visit your pediatrician and nutritionist for additional guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Cut down on Junk food</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Junk foods are high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats which not only puts a burden on the system but also leads to increased cravings and thus, overeating. Avoid giving way to their nagging and look for healthier alternatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Focus on home food</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freshly cooked meals at home are nutritious and healthy. As compared to store-bought items, home-cooked food doesn\u2019t contain additives and harmful chemicals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Participate in outdoor activities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fix a time where both parents and kids can go for a light run or games. It not only maintains the overall health of the family as kids <a></a>learn from elders but also boosts mood and mental health. Encourage kids to play and run outside with other kids instead of staying indoors all day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Keep an eye on the screen usage</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With virtual learning on the rise, screen time has gone up for the kids as well. Check their screen usage and limit when not necessary as it is highly addictive. Make them stretch and do eye exercises in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Check portion size</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often overeating goes unchecked as the portion size is seldom controlled. Try to regulate serving and portion sizes and be sure to include more fibrous items rather than refined foods. Unnecessarily don\u2019t try to overfeed them just to finish excess food.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Educate early on</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behavioral change should be focused more than authoritative procedure as kids who are restricted often finds a way out. Start inculcating healthy habits and let them take part in healthy cooking activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You:</strong> Early intervention is the key to stopping childhood obesity from progressing into adulthood. Be extra cautious if the family has a history of lifestyle disorders. Follow these simple lifestyle modifications and visit your nutritionist for proper guidance.</p>\n",

The vaccinated population is dealing with the infection better as rigorous research is undergoing on the novel virus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the latest report it has been stated that other than the respiratory tract, omicron is affecting the gut health too. More and more people infected by the new strain are experiencing abdominal symptoms. It is important to understand the symptoms better to distinguish them from regular digestive cases and to isolate oneself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are the symptoms to watch out for:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Nausea</li><li>Vomiting</li><li>Abdominal pain</li><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Backache</li><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Stomach ache</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The relation between Omicron and gut health</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although definitive research is still underway, as per reports there has been a strong connection between gut health and omicron. \u201cThis may be due to Omicron infecting the gut mucosa and resulting in inflammation\u201d, says Dr. ManojGoel, Director, Pulmonology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, as quoted by Hindustan Times. He also warns not to pass it off as regular abdominal pain and look out for symptoms to isolate oneself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors said to avoid self-medication <a></a>as it may result in complications. Mild symptoms may not be a matter of concern but taking good care should be an utmost priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips to take care of gut health</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Eat freshly cooked meals rich in fiber and minerals</li><li>Avoid eating outside and avoid sharing meals with others</li><li>Wash raw fruits and vegetables thoroughly washed before consuming</li><li>Maintain food safety and hygiene at all times</li><li>Wash hands properly before consuming food</li><li>Stay hydrated</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You:</strong> The Omicron variant of coronavirus is spreading rapidly and it is best to keep oneself safe at all times following covid-19 safety protocols. Avoid stepping out unless necessary and look out for symptoms if any. It is rightly said as prevention is better than cure, so follow a balanced diet, proper sleep, exercise, and consult the doctor if you experience the symptoms.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Winter is a season of comfort and coziness when we prefer to stay indoors, wrapped under the blanket than braving the cold outside. With reduced physical activities, sun exposure, and an increased tendency to binge eat, winter is also a season that has the potential to affect health negatively if not taken care of properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Appetite suppressants</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tend to sleep and eat more during winters and the festivities may add a few extra kilos by the end of the season. It is important to suppress unnecessary cravings to avoid burdening our system. There are some natural food products that act as suppressants to these hungers and cravings and help to keep our bodies warm as well. They help in maintaining the energy balance and keep you active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, control your appetite with these natural goodies this season:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Apples</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apples help in regulating blood glucose by giving you an energy boost without making you gain weight. It is a good source of fiber and minerals essential in various bodily processes. Have an apple at breakfast or midday for a sustained energy release. Add a twist by having a warm mashed apple with a pinch of cinnamon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Oats</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oats contain a good amount of fiber which meets our satiety and keeps us full for longer. It thus helps in cutting down unnecessary cravings and affects the body positively by reducing cholesterol levels as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Spinach</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no doubt that spinach is one of the healthiest food items as it is rich in plenty of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. It is low in calories and helps in maintaining the metabolism. Incorporate it into the diet in various delicious recipes or as a fresh salad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Beetroot</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beetroot, loaded with antioxidants, is a good replacement for unhealthy sugars. Grab a bite of beetroot salad to stay refreshed throughout the day or have it as dried chips for snacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Almond</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having 3-5 soaked almonds every day in the morning shows a marked difference in overall health. Almonds are rich in vitamin E in their natural oils and are a good source of omega fatty acids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Caffeine (controlled)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caffeine present in dark chocolate, coffee, and green tea is a natural suppressant. It helps in controlling hunger and increasing metabolism, thus helping in being in shape. It improves alertness and concentration too, however, it is recommended not to consume in excess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Fenugreek</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fenugreek has a host of health benefits including blood sugar regulation, cholesterol reduction, managing appetite, and hunger. Soak fenugreek in water overnight, consume it in the morning and incorporate fenugreek in various recipes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You:</strong> Start prioritizing your health by bringing in small changes in your daily life. Ditch the unhealthy junk food and try the natural appetite suppressants to keep you healthy and in good shape all winter long!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Gorging on something you love and feeling guilty soon after? Do you calorie count everything you eat every day and get stressed if it doesn\u2019t fit your plan? Are you constantly worried about putting on weight while eating anything? Well, it\u2019s okay to keep a track of diet plans and healthier habits but not to a length that makes you feel stressed and guilty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a note of these points to overcome your problem and enjoy the process of eating:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. One single food won\u2019t lead to weight gain</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight gain happens over a period of time and a meal may contribute to weight gain rather than a single food ingredient. Suppose a piece of brownie won\u2019t result in weight gain as much as a full brownie added with a scoop of ice cream would do. It is better to focus on healthier alternatives while also understanding the quantity of food.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Control your portion size</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make a diet plan effective it is important not only to focus on the ingredient and menu but also to take care of the portion size. When preparing meals, keeping in mind the serving size helps in controlling portion size. Often we end up eating more to avoid food wastage. Try to have frequent meals instead of heavy meals at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Avoid overindulgence</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the many perils of the fast-food industry is the attentive nature of the products which leaves us craving for more. Often packaged products contain hidden sugar and addictive substan<a></a>ces which leads to overindulgence. Binge-eating while watching TV is also bad for health. The temptation of our favorite dish also leads to over-consumption. Rather than feeling guilty about it, try to fix a quantity at a time and try to consume at different intervals rather than at one go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Stop being hard on yourself</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food nourishes and protects our body which is why we should not treat it as an enemy. Try to take care of your body and seek the help of dietitians and nutritionists who would understand your requirements better. Over more, stop being hard on yourself as punishing yourself would do no good. Try to build a healthy harmony with food for a positive outlook, both physically and mentally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You:</strong> Rather than constantly feeling stressed or guilty about eating, focus on understanding your body needs better and follow simple steps that will help in attaining a holistic approach towards health and wellness.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Eating disorders are often neglected and go unnoticed till the body responds to serious complications that go within the systems. Poor mental health manifested as eating disorders affect overall health to an extent that it impairs everyday functioning. It includes both overeating and self-starvation which can affect both social and personal life. Leave behind the stigma associated with it and look for the signs before it results in grave complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the major health complications associated with eating disorders are listed below,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Nausea and vomiting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common and immediate effects is nausea and vomiting. It results in indigestion and people often end up throwing food to an extent that anything one consumes feels like it would be thrown out. Purging by vomiting depletes the body of essential nutrients and electrolytes. It inversely affects muscle contraction and issues of the digestive tract soon arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Intestinal infections and ulcers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The disruption in eating patterns results directly affecting the intestine as they are responsible for digestion and absorption. The villi lining wears out and ulceration takes place. It results in serious digestive issues and absorption of nutrients is remarkably reduced. As a result, it causes bowel issues too. It in turn affects overall health and takes time to recover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Constipation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Series of complications in the digestive tract leads to constipation as poor consumption of food results in poor digestion and disruption of stool formation. The intestinal muscles weaken and it becomes difficult for the body to release stools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Heart health</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eating disorders result in poor heart health due to many inter-linked factors. The energy requirement is not met from healthy sources, it weakens the heart muscles and affects blood pressure. The blood vessels of the heart cannot supply essential nutrients and an unhealthy diet raises cholesterol levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Hormonal issues</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reduced calorie intake affects the brain and hormone production. It in turn affects organs like the thyroid and also affects fertility. The hormonal imbalance disrupts the menstrual cycle and leads to severe health complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Mental health problems</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mental health and eating disorders are interlinked. Poor mental health results in eating disorders and it, in turn, impairs proper brain functioning. Starvation, fasting deprives the brain of nutrients and drain the body, it affects the everyday functioning of the body, with insomnia, fatigue, reduced concentration, and memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Hair and skin problems</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the clinical signs of poor diet and nutrient absorption is manifested as poor skin and hair health. Low levels of nutrients result in dry, flaky skin, chapped lips, and brittle hair. It may also result in increasing stress levels and greying of hair. Over to You: Early intervention is the key to tackling eating disorders. Talk to a professional or your loved ones and seek help to avoid these complications that might even prove life-threatening in the long run. Bring a positive outlook towards your body and health as it is never too late.</p>\n",

It was a hard way to learn that our health is indeed our wealth. Scientists, researchers, and health professionals have emphasized the importance of diet quality in preventing the severity of the disease and also aiding in recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The approach</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after an individual has recovered from Covid, the aftermath is nothing less of a battlefield with several complications ranging from fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, weakened immune system, and several complications affecting lungs and the heart. A diet targeted at these complications helps in easing the situation. As WHO recommends having a balanced diet focused on building immunity and strength is essential in battling Covid. Several studies have also indicated the importance of plant-based nutrition in tackling complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Plant-based diet</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A plant-based diet must not be confused with a vegan diet which debars consuming any animal product or by-products. Plant-based nutrition focuses mainly on plant produce like fruits, vegetables, cereals, grains, seeds, legumes while also consuming animal products as per preference. The focus would be including more plant-based items which are rich in phytochemicals, antioxidants, and fiber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips for a plant-based nutrition</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Your daily diet should include assorted <strong>colorful</strong> fruits and vegetables. The pigments that result in the color have health benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Opt for <strong>seasonal produce</strong> as they are nutrient-dense and a chance of adulteration is less. Have seasonal fruits and locally available foods more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Include <strong>grains</strong> and millets like ragi, bajra, jowar, quinoa, and oats. Cut down refined grains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Try not to deep fry foods, instead prefer foods and vegetables grilled, boiled, or stewed to <strong>retain maximum nutrients</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Consume foods as <strong>fresh</strong> as possible rather than storing them for days. Avoid storing cut fruits and vegetables. Opt for freshly prepared salads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Include <strong>lean protein</strong> and soy products like tofu, tempeh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Focus on your <strong>gut health</strong> and consume naturally probiotic foods like yogurt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. Add <strong>seeds and nuts</strong> to daily diet like chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, watermelon seeds, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits of a plant-based diet</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. They provide a good amount of fiber, minerals, vitamins, and phytochemicals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. They improve metabolism and the digestive system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. They reduce the onset of lifestyle disorders and improve immunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. It aids in weight loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You:</strong> Covid-19 affected individuals with existing conditions harshly and left healthy ones with several morbidities.

      "rendered": "\n<p>The harvest season is celebrated differently all across the country, from <strong>Lohri</strong> in the north to <strong>Pongal</strong> in the south, <strong>Uttarayan</strong> in the west to <strong>MaghBihu</strong> in the east. <strong>MakarSankranti</strong> too marks the beginning of this festive season with celebrations ranging from flying kites to preparing delicacies with the new harvest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These festivals are a reminder of our cultural unity and diversity and it is important to engage kids in the festivity. MakarSankranti is the day when the sun travels into the new zodiac Capricorn, with Makara being Capricorn and Sankranti standing for the movement of the Sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most significant aspects of the festival is the celebration of harvest and food. Here is a list of traditional foods that are an integral part of the festival and the recipe ideas that can be easily prepared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Sugarcane</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sugarcane or \u201cganna\u201d is very significant, produced especially in the northern parts of the country. It is turned into jaggery and sugarcane sticks are very important in rituals too. Sugarcane is one of the best sources of energy as it provides glucose to the body. It is good for digestion and is recommended to have during midday. It is drunk as juice, eaten straight from the sticks, or used in various preparations as jaggery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Rice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rice is a very important part of the festival and the celebrations surround its harvest. A host of recipes with rice as the main ingredient is prepared across the country. Rice is used to prepare Pongal (sweet, chakkara), curd rice, payasam, kheer, pithepuli, Nolen gurerpayesh, badam halwa, and barfi to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Jaggery</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaggery is aromatic during winters with fresh palm harvests and it is loaded with healthy minerals like iron which is important for treating anemia. It maintains reproductive health and reduces fatigue and tiredness. It is used in the preparation of pithe, kheer, laddoos, bars, halwa, tilgud, along with various other sweet dishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Sesame seeds</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These nutritious seeds are a must-have this festive winter season.

      "rendered": "\n<p>Iron is an important mineral associated with growth, development, circulation, and various physiological processes. Iron is associated with making hemoglobin which carries oxygen throughout the body. Iron is specifically important for women as it is crucial during pregnancy and lactation. It is important for prenatal development too. Anemia due to iron deficiency is far too common in the population hence it needs to be addressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some simple ways you can improve your iron levels,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Go Green</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green leafy vegetables are a rich source of iron and it is important to include dark leafy vegetables in the diet. Include red saag, spinach, kulekhera in the diet. The water of kulekherasaag is very beneficial for improving iron levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Jazz with Jaggery</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaggery is rich in iron along with other minerals. It is important to incorporate it into the diet like as chikki or laddoos with peanuts and sesame seeds. Many recipes also incorporate pulses and jaggery which is a good way to supply iron.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Fix a date with Dates</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dates should be part of your daily diet as they are loaded with nutrients. Have a handful of dates every day as a snack or after-meal treat. Include it with vitamin-rich food for better absorption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Rajgira Rules</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rajgira or amaranth is a rich source of calcium and iron. It is a very nutritious grain and is considered a superfood. It is low in calories and carbohydrates. It can be eaten as porridge, parathas, Laddoo, or as roasted and seasoned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Edgy Eggs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eggs are a good source of heme iron which is crucial for many developmental processes in the body. Incorporate egg in your diet, better in the boiled form to receive its maximum benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Kadhai Cares</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooking in iron Tawa or kadhai is often practiced to supply iron in food as the cast iron supplies iron to the food that is cooked in it. However excess of anything is harmful so be mindful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having sufficient iron in the diet is very important to have a healthy life and to prevent risks associated with deficiency. Including these foods will help in supplying both heme and non-heme iron in your body.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Even today there are taboo surrounding sex and sexual health that prevents many to speak about it openly. Sex education is also not properly discussed which has resulted in the birth of several myths and misconceptions. People find it uncomfortable, shy, and even anxious when they are asked about sexual health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lack of proper communication and awareness has resulted in the birth of several myths and we plan to bust some of them for you!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Condoms are not effective?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Condoms are one of the most easily accessible and affordable contraceptives available in the market. It is essential for safe and protected sex. It not only protects against pregnancy but also against a host of diseases that can be transmitted because of unprotected sex. While one may feel it doesn\u2019t protect oneself completely, it may be partly true because a chance of lapse may happen. However, it is either due to inappropriate size, tear, or hole in the condom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Sexual Health checkup is not for the ones having exclusive and limited sex?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t have sex that often it is essential to go for regular checkups for early detection of any symptoms you might be having which often can go unnoticed. This is a precautionary step towards better and safer sexual health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Oral sex can make you pregnant?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, oral sex or ingesting sperms will not make you pregnant as sperm needs to be fused with the egg released from the fallopian tube in the vagina to be able to get you pregnant. It is important to practice safe sex and to use a condom even during oral sex as many STDs can be transmitted during the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. You can get STDs even if you don\u2019t have penetrative sex?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>STDs can spread from skin to skin contact and in bodily fluids hence they can be transmitted via any type of sex be it vaginal, anal oral, or even sex toys. It is important to use physical protection and contraception whenever one is with an STD-infected individual. It is important to go for regular health checkups too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Hormonal birth control is bad?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is really an individual\u2019s choice as to what one prefers, it is however important to consult your doctor and gynecologist for any possible complications or side effects as per one\u2019s body system and condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to discuss sexual health and fact-check rumors and misconceptions for a healthier and safer society.</p>\n",

In the world of medical and healthcare, it is no different as we saw a remarkable increase in co-dependence of healthcare on technology and how it is shaping our future to make lives simpler and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look into some of the healthcare trends that can shape the health industry of 2022 in a greater way.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Genomics</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The customized and personalized health system has evolved to go into our genomes for better results and solutions to things that were not possible until a few years back. Genomics and gene editing is very crucial to treat complicated conditions and diseases. The specific traits are inherited by living cells and they determine the phenotypes and genotypes. By manipulating these phenotypes, scientists are advancing towards treatments of various diseases like cancer, heart ailments, and muscular dystrophy.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Biohacking</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A trend that is gaining popularity in western countries is simply a technique of tracking your body cycle and controlling your own biology. It is a product of the individual traits and environmental factors affecting one\u2019s body and system. By altering some basic steps one can achieve the best version of oneself, thanks to biohacking!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Flexitarian Diet</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time this diet is gathering popularity because of its approach of a gradual shift from non-vegetarian to a vegetarian diet and finally to a plant-based diet. It focuses on sustainability and reducing carbon footprints. Instead of rapid shift, this focuses on slow but steady progress to be flexible enough. It also limits the consumption of highly processed, refined, and sugar items.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>AI</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>AI or artificial intelligence is crucial to look into a patient\u2019s Electronic Health Record (EHR) and predict possible health outcomes. It is an important tool to prevent conditions and early diagnosis and detection. Digitization of data like from Covid-19 tests has helped in intertwining to build AI models which will help in discovering new treatments and aid in research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> It is important to stay aware of the latest news and trends that are going on in the health industry. The advancement of technology in recent years has shaped the industry largely and it is important to look at how they evolve in time to come.</p>\n",

Many even engage in strict diets before a festival so that they can indulge guilt-free during the occasion. Being surrounded by delicacies, however, many can\u2019t control their cravings and end up overindulging, leading to weight gain and a host of other complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cravings ain\u2019t hunger</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is quite a difference between hunger and cravings. Hunger is a normal mechanism of the body\u2019s demand for food which occurs mostly if you skip or delay your regular meal timings, or after working very hard. Hunger is mostly accompanied by stomach grumbles, headache, fatigue and they mostly go away after providing the body with energy and food.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cravings on the other hand are mostly a mind game where your feelings and desire to eat something overpower. You may not be hungry when you are craving some food. It mostly is targeted at delicacies and unhealthy junk which makes us \u201cfeel good\u201d after consuming whatever we have been craving. Often the quantity is not regulated and overindulgence is common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few tips to control your cravings this festive season-</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Avoid starving yourself. This way you will avoid overindulging, especially upon unhealthy junk food. Try following a proper meal schedule and grab a healthy snack whenever cravings kick in.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Avoid caffeine and alcohol as it drains water and causes dehydration. It also causes mood swings resulting in craving food and drinks while not being hungry. It also increases our sugar cravings which are detrimental to health in the long run.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cut down foods that are rich in fats, sugar, and salts including highly processed items. A pack of chips has addictive substances which increase cravings and thus are bad for health.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Incorporate a fiber and protein-rich diet. Adding loads of vegetables, fruits, and lean meat is a great way to tackle unnecessary hunger as they help in regulating hormones and metabolism.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>When thirsty reach out for water instead of aerated and sugary drinks which not only makes you even thirstier but also are bad for your health. Try having herbal juices or decoctions instead of carbonated drinks.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Realize your craving pattern and keep a note of it. Instead of punishing yourself and indulging guilt-free, try having your favorite food once in a while.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> Avoid being too hard on yourself all at once, instead, keep short-term goals to understand your body better. It is easy to meet goals when you have strong determination and a track laid out. Follow these simple tips as the first step towards tackling your mindless cravings this festive season.</p>\n",

Wait, it\u2019s not done yet as we are here with our warning call to prevent you from making 5 common mistakes this winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Reminder: Water</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reduced thirst and perspiration lead to low water consumption during winters as compared to summers. But don\u2019t let it lead to dehydration as water is required in sufficient amounts for various body functions like transportation of nutrients and elimination of wastes, regulating temperature, and keeping your skin healthy. So, fill up your bottles and make sure to finish them by the end of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Check your carbs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During winters our activities reduce too and we tend to spend lesser energy but make sure you adjust your diet accordingly. Carbohydrates need to be cut down a bit if the energy expenditure is reduced else it will lead to unnecessary weight gain. Try shifting to more complex carbs rather than refined ones and keep dinners light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Cut short caffeine</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3 Cs of winter would probably be Chocolate, Coffee, and Caffeine! We often end up consuming quite a great deal of caffeine in the form of hot chocolates, chocolates, teas, and coffee to warm us up but what it really does, in the long run, is adversely affect it and also increase dehydration. Make sure not to over-consume caffeine this winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Binge eating</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing like the comfort of sitting on a warm couch wrapped in a blanket, catching up on your favorite shows, and binge eating, endlessly. Wait, did you keep a track of those packs of snacks? By the time you finish your show and get up, you would have done the damage of overconsuming a junk or unhealthy snack! Switch them with a limited portion of healthy snacks like nuts, dates, seed mix, fruits, veggie sticks, or roasted pulses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Vitamins C and D</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, don\u2019t forget to focus on your vitamins as it will help in adjusting to the weather change and reduce the chances of catching cough and cold. Take the best of the season by consuming lots of citrus fruits like those fresh oranges and basking in the winter sun!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Don\u2019t let the harsh winters take the best of your health, instead, enjoy the weather while taking care of your health while following these tips to avoid mistakes that you would end up regretting!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Coming across several myths have become a part and parcel of daily life as an overload of information in the various platform are on the rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we end 2021, let\u2019s look at some of the popular myths and bust them with facts for a healthier approach in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 1: Cholesterol is bad for health</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Cholesterol is a fatty substance that is necessary for several body mechanisms like nerve transmission. However, it is the type of cholesterol and the amount that matters. Most of the cholesterol, about 80% is produced by our liver and the rest comes from food sources of animal origin like eggs, meat, dairy, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 2: Finding a lump in the breast means you have breast cancer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fact:</strong> often the lump found in the breast does not lead to cancer hence early diagnosis and intervention are very important. Try self-examining your breasts and in case you find a lump don\u2019t panic but visit your doctor without delay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 3: Sunshine supplies vitamin D</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Sunshine helps in converting the inactive Vitamin D into an active one which the body then can process. Vitamin D is very common as people don\u2019t consume enough vitamin D-rich foods. Make sure to have foods fortified with vitamin D like milk and milk products. Also fat is essential for its absorption in the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 4: Diet and nutrition has no relation to depression</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Poor diet and unavailability of proper food are the main causes of depression. Poor dietary habits like having foods rich in fats, salt, and sugar are some of the leading causes of cravings, mood swings, and depression. On the other hand, there are many foods rich in antioxidants and fiber that are known to reduce depression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> It is important not to follow everything related to health and food one finds on the internet as most often the trends turn out to be myths. Fact-check from reliable sources as we attempt in busting some common myths and misconceptions of 2021!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>There are many foods that used to be part of our diet and culture but are soon vanishing over the years as more processed and junk foods are finding their way into the market. Often we hear our grandparents narrate about certain foods and recipes we never heard of but were a nutrition powerhouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These foods are not only rich in nutrients but are essential to maintain biodiversity and beat climate change. In this fast paced-life let\u2019s pause and look at some forgotten foods that should find their way back into our plates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Rajgira (Amaranth)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long before oats or quinoa became hype, we had our own superfood called rajgira or amaranth. It is consumed as saag and the grain-like seeds are nutritionally dense being rich in vitamins and minerals like calcium, protein and have low calories. It has several health benefits like it reduces the risk of cancer, heart diseases, maintains bone health, fights inflammation, and keeps the digestive system healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Targola/ Taal (Ice apple)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a type of palm having delicate fleshy fruit coated with a hard exterior that is available during summers. It is rich in vital nutrients and minerals like potassium, magnesium, calcium, and vitamins like C, A, E, and K. it is a low-calorie food that keeps the system cool and is rich in phytochemicals.<a></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Phalsa (Indian sherbet berries)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are tiny berries that are dark purple in color and are available seasonally. They are extremely healthy, nutritionally dense, and are rich in calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and vitamin C. It is similar to blueberries but is smaller. It is perfect for summers because of its cooling property. It is consumed simply with salt or spices but can be prepared into syrup or jam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Bael (wood apple)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also called Bengal quince this is a rare tree native to the Indian subcontinent whose leaves are used to worship and the fruit in a hard shell is consumed as sherbet in summers. It has a cooling property and has a host of health benefits like curing digestive issues, maintaining liver health, and is anti-inflammatory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> Take a break from all the processed and packaged foods and try looking for these native items that are rich in vital nutrients but are slowly being forgotten.</p>\n",

So, let\u2019s get started with the 20 best health tips to watch out for this New Year!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Beauty of Sleep</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take our advice and make it a resolution to stick to your sleep routine of adequate sleep. It will not only provide you renewed energy throughout the day but also prevent many illnesses. So, have your beauty sleep!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Hydrate-Hydrate-Hydrate</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to ditch unhealthy beverages and have sufficient water throughout the day. Install a reminder app in case you are too occupied to remember every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Limit Packaged foods</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Packaged foods are often highly processed with far more salt, sugar, and fats than is recommended. Try to fix the number of processed items you would consume in a week and slowly but steadily bring it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Snack healthy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switch unhealthy snacks and junks with healthy ones like roasted pulses, seeds, nuts, and dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Get moving</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go for a morning jog or evening run whichever works best and make sure to leave your couch and get moving!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Watch what you drink</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When thirsty, avoid reaching out to colas and sugary drinks. Instead, try having cucumber juice, mint lemonade, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Increase season\u2019s goodness</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indulge in a variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables that are rich in phytochemicals, fiber, and antioxidants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Reduce screen time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cut-off screen time and spend more time on activities and spending time with family and friends. Set a timer for your screen to monitor better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Run away from fad diets</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t fall for diet trends and fast weight loss programs, rather adopt a sustainable approach towards your diet and have balanced meals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Pack your lunch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of eating unhealthy food outside, carry your lunch and plan it well in advance as it makes the task easier. You will save money too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. Quit unhealthy habits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take time and figure out your unhealthy habits and try to quit them this year. Ask your friends and family for help if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12. Take up your hobbies</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go back to your paintbrush, piano, or dancing shoes and make it a point to indulge in your lost hobbies at least once a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>13. Go Green</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surround yourself with plants and watch positivity radiate out and within. You can take up kitchen gardening as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>14. Gather experiences</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tick off the list of experiences you always wanted to do and go for it, like scuba diving or paragliding, whatever you always wished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>15. Lift weights</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strength training is very crucial for proper muscle growth so try doing it throughout the year diligently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>16. Take time off</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balance your personal and professional life and take time off when needed. Go for trips or meet up with old friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>17. Know what\u2019s bad</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Limit alcohol and foods you know would do more harm than good in the long run. Set short goals and achieve them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>18. Beat the stress</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reduce stress and indulge in activities that keep you cool and composed. Have stress buster foods and exercise regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>19. Don\u2019t skip meals</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t skip your meals be it breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Manage your time well and resort to healthier options, always!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We often take for granted our sleep cycle as something manageable throughout the day but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>20. Find inner peace</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can\u2019t focus enough on the importance of meditation and yoga in promoting good health.

      "rendered": "\n<p>Rice has been a staple food for millions over the centuries. Rice is a good source of energy that is readily available. However, in recent years the sedentary lifestyle has increased due to desk jobs and several other lifestyle changes. Our diet thus seeks less refined carbs and more fiber and nutrients. Weight watchers, keto-dieters, and people looking for healthier alternatives to White Rice, which contains a fair amount of starch, is on the rise recently. We list out a few low-carb rice substitutes that you can incorporate into your daily diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Quinoa</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quinoa is considered a superfood because of the nutrient-dense nature of the grain which is not lost during processing. It is rich in protein calcium, fiber, and vital minerals which makes it a good rice substitute. You can incorporate it in meals or have salads out of it. It keeps you full longer thus is great for weight loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Amaranth</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amaranth or rajgira is a native Indian grain that is like quinoa rich in nutrients particularly calcium. It has good satiety value and has a series of health benefits including promoting bone and muscle health, aiding in digestion, protecting against certain types of cancers, protecting heart health, and aiding in weight loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.

      "rendered": "\n<p>Digital screens have become an inevitable part of our daily lives and we almost cannot do without them. Recently, with longer screen times due to work be it in office cabins or as work from home, eyes are taking all the burden. Unlike physical paper or books, digital screens have emissions, and a combination of glare, contrast, light, and brightness causes harm to the eyes as eye muscles are not that adaptive to those settings for longer hours. We often tend to blink less when we look at screens and the distance between the eyes and screens is often compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to take care of eyes while working in front of screens as it has serious repercussions other than poor or blurred vision, some being directly affecting the nervous system and brain, leading to dizziness, headache, and loss of balance. Indulging in late-night digital screens affects the sleep cycle and results in insomnia too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some quick and simple methods to improve your eye health while working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. 20-20-20 rule</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experiencing burning sensation, watery eyes, itchiness or strain is very common while working long hours in front of the screen. To combat that follow the 20-20-20 rule per which you need to take a 20-second break after every 20 minutes. During that time look for some distant objects and relax your eye muscles. Eyeball movement is also recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Use anti-glares</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anti-glares are the anti-reflective coating that is applied to eyeglasses to reduce the amount of glare that is reflected from the screen. It helps in reducing fatigue and improves focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Wash often</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Splashing water once in a while not only cools the eyes but also reduced eye dryness and itchiness. The screens and air-conditioned setup tend to make eyes dry. Try having some eye drops handy as well and rinse with water often. It improves concentration and thereby productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Blink more</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While continuously looking towards the screen we often blink less. Be alert and try to blink more for eye muscles to work properly. It helps to release strain and focus better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Vitamin A rich diet</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitamin A in form of retinol and beta-carotene is directly related to eye health. It improves vision and prevents many eye-related problems like night blindness, bitot&#8217;s spots, etc. Include vitamin A-rich foods like green leafy vegetables, carrots, and eggs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><strong>Over to You</strong></a> It is important not to neglect eye health as it might lead to eye damage in the long run. Apart from following these methods, go for regular eye checkups to keep your eyes in good health.</p>\n",

There are days, especially in winters where we often forget to have sufficient water and it affects the body in some way or the other. Poor hydration is linked to low concentration, poor performance and recently has been associated with several chronic conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Water is the key</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 60-65 % of the human body is composed of water right from the blood that flows throughout the body to digestive juices, water is essential for every cell integrity. Water excretes out waste products from our body in form of perspiration and urine, hence for the proper functioning of kidneys too we require sufficient water every day. An adult requires about 3-4 liters of water per day as the requirement increases over summers. Even though our perspiration is low during winters, we should not skip the daily requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Water: a vital nutrient&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Lubricant</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Water act as a lubricant that helps the body to defend against shocks. It is present as fluid matter in cells and tissues and makes movement easier. It is present in fluids and mucus which are very essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Transport system</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major roles of water in the body is to transport nutrients and electrolytes to every cell in the body as blood and flush out toxins via urine and sweat. Water is very essential for the proper functioning of all organs.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Body temperature regulator</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying hydrated at all weather conditions is vital for regulating the temperature of the body as water helps in releasing heat via sweat and regulates the thermal state of the body. Likewise, the temperature of the water itself helps adjust to changing weather conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Creates Saliva</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Saliva is one of the crucial factors of digestion as amylase in saliva begins the process from the mouth. Water is essential in creating saliva as lack of it makes our mouth and throat dry. Hence, adequate consumption of water is essential for sufficient saliva formation.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Skin integrity</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Water helps maintain the rigidity of each cell and is very important for healthy and glowing skin. It makes skin supple and delays the aging the skin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Water is a basic necessity of life and one must take care of having safe water every day. Try having different healthy decoctions and beverages along to increase the nutrient content and even maintain a reminder app in case you have the habit of forgetting about having water timely!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>We rarely find information on nutrition concerning sexual health and intimacy as the internet is flooded with tons of articles targeting other aspects of the body. But Hush! Hush! no more as we bring forth one of the most neglected but important aspects of health: intimacy nutrition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intimacy is often mistaken to mean just sex but it encompasses several forms of affection and care. There are foods that help in improving intimacy and sexual health thereby reducing stress and improving fertility in both men and women. An increase in stress results in a host of issues like insomnia, high blood pressure, weak immunity, irritable bowel syndrome, and many others. Here are some tips and tricks to improve your intimacy and sexual health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Eat right</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diet rich in phytochemicals, minerals like zinc, selenium, iron, calcium, and healthy fats like omega fatty acids helps in improving sexual health and wellbeing. Try having nuts like almonds, pistachios, cashews, walnuts, and seeds of watermelon, pumpkin, flax; fish, and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Exercise</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is very important to exercise every day to maintain a good physical and mental state. The hormones released during exercising and workout improve mood and help in thinking better. Try practicing yoga and meditation early morning to receive all the good vibes and positive energy. Exercising and doing yoga together with a partner also improves intimacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Pamper yourself and your partner</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once in a while indulge in a good pamper like spa therapy, massage, manicure, pedicure, and top it up with a good bath. Pampering and taking care of one\u2019s body helps in releasing feel-good hormones and also releases stress and toxins from the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Sleep cycle</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving sleep cycle and maintaining a proper routine keeps the day in balance and improves mood, concentration, and sexual health. Limiting screen time at night is also very vital. Try resting when you feel exhausted and maintain a proper sleep routine, even a nap helps in rejuvenating the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><strong>Over to you</strong></a> Improving intimacy helps in releasing stress and combating several ailments related to it. As important as it is to take care of everything else, it is equally important to take care of your sexual health and wellbeing.</p>\n",

It is true that with age body\u2019s ability to move and mobility reduces but with proper lifestyle and exercises one can live stronger. Exercise and workouts for the elder population are important as they need to be aptly designed to suit the metabolism and the age factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several physiological changes happen as one gets old, from reduced appetite, reduced metabolism to several underlying health issues. Thus, exercise for the elderly has to be simple and less straining. Here are some basic stretches to swear by during old age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Shoulder stretch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoulders are important to perform basic functions like wearing clothes and grabbing things from a higher shelf. Shoulder stretching should be done daily during the morning and evening by small slow rotations. It will keep the joints motile and healthy along with muscle relaxation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Neck stretch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This stretch is beneficial for the tensed muscle around the neck and easing out pain and discomfort. Try various neck stretching exercises like moving the neck sideways or tilting front and back. It will help make the neck less stiff and more flexible. Also, pay attention to the pillow and the level at which pillows are kept. Try not to do a certain work resting neck at a position for longer durations and move from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Ankle rotation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This part is often overlooked but is very important for maintaining body balance and posture. Rotating the ankle can help reduce stiffness and prevent falls and injuries by stumbling. Wear proper foot wares which are anti-skid and soft soles. For this exercise, keep your feet straight on a plane surface and rotate your ankles and move sideways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Backstretch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elderly, especially women are prone to osteoporosis and poor bone health. Many face back issues and trouble sitting or standing for long durations. Follow basic stretches of the back to ease back pain and discomfort. Try touching feet by bending down slowly and getting up and facing backward. Put your hand on the waist and rotate the pelvic area round and round. One can also stretch sideways by grabbing the waist on both sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> Exercise and workout should be part of every age group including the elderly which requires special attention. Stretching and light-free hand exercises not only help in strengthening the body but also help in increasing longevity.</p>\n",

No doubt, winter brings with it the lethargic feeling and so it is even more important to stay fit and energized and not let the seasons have their toll on health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are worried about where to start from, we got you covered with 5 ways you can stay healthy, energized, and fit this spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Hydration is the key</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often due to change in seasons we rely on thirst and forget about drinking water. However, it is important to have sufficient water and healthy beverages to keep you hydrated throughout the day. Have herbal teas, smoothies, juices along with a regular water routine to supply essential nutrients along with. You may even download an app to remind you to have water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Load up seasonal produce</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to get ample nutrients from nature is to consume seasonal and fresh produce. The seasonal produce offers the essential nutrients that are metabolized in the body better. Also, avoid consuming foods that are non-seasonal as they often tend to lack adequate nutrients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Get moving</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to beat lethargy and laziness is to be active on a daily basis by exercising, playing, or running. A sedentary lifestyle is the root cause of many illnesses and disorders and leads to poor muscle and bone health. Try exercising for at least 30 minutes five days a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Immunity focus</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Immunity is a key focus area to combat illness and to avoid getting sick due to changes in weather conditions. The shift in seasons causes one to be more prone to catching cough, cold and common flu as microbes thrive better when temperatures are ambient. Make sure to have loads of antioxidant-rich foods like fruits and vegetables and prepare healthy drinks and herbal teas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. A sound Sleep</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last one is a very important one which is ending the day with a sound sleep. A night of good sleep is vital to unwind the body, reduce stress, and energize the body on waking up. Insufficient sleep will result in headaches and lethargy throughout the day so it\u2019s important to have good quality sleep. Maintaining sleep time is equally important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> A shift in season can be challenging but keep in mind the above pointers and stay energized throughout the new season.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>The dilemma surrounding what to eat and what not to? Confused about which health tips to follow and which myths to bust? Worry not as you aren\u2019t alone and we got you covered by debunking some common misconceptions and myths related to health and nutrition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 1: Carbs are bad for diabetes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fact 1: It is the type and quantity of carbs that determines whether it is bad for diabetes or not. No doubt refined carbs are not recommended for diabetics but including complex carbs in daily diet can manage diabetes better. Thus, all carbs are not bad and complex carbs that help in keeping satiated longer and manage blood glucose levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 2: Label with fat-free can be consumed limitless</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fact 2: Food packages labeled fat-free may contain preservatives, sweeteners, and other additives which is not recommended to be consumed in huge amounts. These products may be rich in calories, have trace fats, and are not completely fat-free. Consuming such products by reading the entire label thoroughly and limiting consumption should be the key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 3: While eating out, salads are the best options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fact 3: Ready-to-eat salads are generally high in calories and have dressings that are rich in fats. Preparing homemade salads using fresh ingredients is not only nutrient-dense but safer as well. Often store-bought salads have no guarantee of freshness or may contain unnecessary preservatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myths 4: Gluten-free diet is the healthiest</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fact 4: Gluten-free diet is meant for individuals with celiac disease or persons who are sensitive or intolerant towards gluten. It is not a weight loss diet and neither was it meant to be one. People without gluten-related complications are not recommended to follow it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 5: Vegan and vegetarian diets don\u2019t supply enough protein</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fact 5: There are plentiful vegetarian and vegan options to supply a good amount of protein but one must consume adequate quantities. Animal protein tends to get absorbed easier and plant sources contain many anti-nutrients to counter it. Make sure to include loads of beans, pulses, legumes, grains, leafy vegetables, and soybean and soy products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> Rather than following a diet trend or eliminating an ingredient blindly by following a post or article on the internet, it is better to consult the dietitian or nutritionist for proper guidance. It is better to fact-check before giving way to myths and misconceptions.</p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "\n<p>A keto diet is a diet plan that focuses on the consumption of healthy fats, a good amount of protein, and a few carbohydrates. The diet primarily targets on fats from healthy sources and limiting carbohydrates to a minimum. The soul energy provider which is fats gets utilized and the reduced carb intake doesn\u2019t get stored in the body instead it depletes the sugar reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Keto diet has shown several benefits however careful planning and close monitoring and guidance are recommended. Here is a list of seven benefits of the keto diet to look up to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Supports weight loss</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diet low in carbs works far better than a diet low in fats as the carb<a></a>s are no longer stored and are utilized along with the main energy source which is fats. It also meets the satiety level so cravings are controlled as well. This shift of energy source results in rapid weight loss, much quicker than diets with low fats. However one must take note that this can work for a maximum of 6 months following which it works just like any other weight loss program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Improved heart health</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The healthy fats supplied in a keto diet are beneficial for the heart as omega fatty acids are known to maintain heart health. The source of fats however needs to be healthy as unhealthy fats will fail the cause. Avocadoes for example when consumed reduced the levels of VLDL and LDL cholesterol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Reduced blood sugar levels</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reduced carbohydrate intake results in reduced blood glucose and thus is good for preventing many diseases. It reduces obesity and overweight and manages glucose in the blood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. May Lower Blood Pressure</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Keto diet is good for lowering blood pressure and reducing hypertension as a diet low in carbohydrates reduces the chances of stroke, heart attack, and kidney issues. It helps in regulating blood sugar levels thus preventing the risk of many diseases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Improve Brain Function</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fat is extremely beneficial for brain health as it improves concentration, memory, and several neuroprotective benefits. Extensive research is being conducted around the world for its potential to treat several brain conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Potentially reduces seizures</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Keto diet is known to treat several cases of seizures and epilepsy where a diet rich in fats is extremely beneficial. It is useful in treating patients with Alzheimer\u2019s and several brain disorders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Reduced Appetite</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many give up on diets because of increased hunger cravings which ultimately result in increased food consumption but the keto diet supplies a good amount of healthy fats which meets satiety and reduces appetite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> The Keto diet has many benefits, some of which are mentioned here. However, one must follow the guidance of a nutritionist or dietitian for an effective diet plan that is sustainable at the same time.</p>\n",

Consuming unhealthy fats and refined grains in the keto diet is a strict no as they are no good to our system. While you may be clear with what to include on a keto diet, it is better to look at the list of foods to avoid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Juice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juice and sugary drinks supply a good amount of sugar which readily shoots up the blood glucose levels. It hinders the process that the keto diet follows and makes you hungrier. Once in a while juice is okay to supply essential nutrients and vitamins but it is best to avoid sugary fruit juices and drinks. Consume coconut water or decoction of herbs if you seek some refreshing hydration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Starchy vegetables</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starchy vegetables are rich in starch which is basically a carbohydrate. One must avoid starchy vegetables like potatoes, tapioca, yam, corn, squash to name a few when following a keto diet. Opt for non-starchy vegetables for which options are plenty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Cereals</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breakfast cereals are loaded with carbs and hidden sugars which are not at all healthy. Corn flakes are cereals made of refined carbs that are strictly to be avoided. Rice, rice flakes, semolina, sago are best left out from the diet. Opt for a non-carb source like quinoa which is rich in essential vitamins and minerals and also being keto-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Unhealthy junks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While keto allows consumption of a fat-rich diet it does not mean one can have deep fried foods and unhealthy junk foods rich in fats. One must avoid heavily fried and fatty foods which are rich in trans-fats and saturated fats which increase the levels of bad cholesterol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Sugary dishes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snacks and desserts rich in sugar are to be avoided on a keto diet as they are rich in carbohydrates and increase the level of glucose in the blood rapidly. Avoid sweetened yogurts and desserts made out of refined grains and sugar like payasam and kheer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> One must be careful while selecting food items to include and avoid while following a keto diet. Avoid this list of foods that are not at all keto-friendly and seek the advice of your nutritionist for a more personalized keto-diet plan.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>The Keto diet brings forth a shift in macronutrients which was primarily focused on carbohydrates to a diet that is low on carbohydrates and high in fats. Planning a keto diet is not too easy and one needs proper and careful guidance to do the switch. It does not involve completely removing carbohydrates from the diet or gulping on foods rich in unhealthy fats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While on a keto diet, many find themselves in the dilemma of whether certain food will be good for the diet or not. Here we have curated a list of five foods that one can consume on a keto diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Eggs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eggs are a nutrition powerhouse, albumin rich in protein and the yolk rich in healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and biotin. Eggs are low in carbohydrates, thus making them a good keto diet option. Have an egg or two a day in various recipes like salad, pudding, omelet, French toast, or simply consume boiled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Low carb veggies</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One important switch to be made in a keto diet is replacing starchy vegetables like tubers and potatoes with leafy, fibrous vegetables like spinach and kale. Cauliflower and cabbage are popular keto diet veggies like pizzas made out of cabbage base and rice made of cauliflower instead of wheat and rice respectively. Include veggies like broccoli, mushroom, green leafy vegetables which are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals are known to have a protective effect on the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Seafood</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seafood is rich in minerals like zinc, potassium, selenium, and natural salts which are good for the keto diet. Include seafood like oysters, squids once in a while and fatty fish can be consumed guilt-free in a keto diet. The carbohydrate content in seafood varies as per type but they are generally low in carbohydrate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Meat</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lean meat and red meat, both can be consumed on a keto diet as per preference however target should be to choose ones that are low in carbohydrates and high in protein and fats. They are essential for building muscle mass and providing energy for daily activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Avocado</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the many perks of following a keto diet is to relish tasty foods that are rich in fats, guilt-free, like avocado for example. It is a delicious and must-have option while on a keto diet as it is essentially rich in healthy fats and vitamins. Include it in the diet as a salad or a dip or upon toast with garlic and chili flakes for a yummy snack option that is filling at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Include these keto-friendly foods in your keto diet which are a source of healthy fats and nutrients instead of looking for unhealthy fatty foods which do the body no good. Consult your nutritionist for personalized guidance on a keto diet.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Shifting from a regular routine to a new planned diet may get challenging initially for beginners and will involve a lot of learning in the process. The key factor whenever a new diet like a keto diet is being followed is to be consistently patient and not to give up halfway. Here we provide a list of five tips on a keto diet for beginners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Reduce Stress</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stress indirectly affects the body\u2019s ability to respond to a keto diet. Cortisol, the stress hormone ends up elevating the body\u2019s blood sugar levels. Thus, due to the presence of excess sugar in the blood prevents the body from burning fat for energy. Chronic stress can, therefore, severely hinder the body\u2019s ability to enter ketosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Prioritize Sleep</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining a proper sleep cycle every day is essential for good health and wellbeing. Adequate sleep and having a proper schedule are crucial to reducing stress levels and thus make the keto diet effective. Studies indicate that a proper sleep of 8-9 hours helps in effective weight management and mental wellbeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Exercise Frequently</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercising at least 5-6 days a week is important to utilize the stored energy reserve as glycogen stores effectively. While exercising, fats, carbs, amino acids all get utilized and muscle formation takes place too. On a keto diet, the transition from a high-carb diet to a high-fat diet takes place smoothly and effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Regulate Salt Intake</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, it is advisable to reduce salt intake and keep it to a minimum. However, in the case of the keto diet, salt intake can be up a little bit. In a keto diet, the carbohydrate intake is reduced and the insulin is reduced too, excretion of salts takes place in comparatively larger amounts. Thus, regulating salt intake while on a keto diet is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Drink plenty of water</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying hydrated is very crucial while on a keto diet since reduced carb intake increases water release from the body. Also, exercise when done with the keto diet releases more sweat than usual.&nbsp; Include hydrating recipes of healthy drinks along with water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> A Keto diet may seem difficult to follow for beginners but careful planning and proper guidance can do wonders to meet your health goals. It is important to consult your nutritionist before shifting to a keto diet as it may not seem easy to shift from a diet that is high in carbs to a diet that focuses on fats.</p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "\n<p>Debunking myths in recent times has become a herculean task when everyone looks up to search engines like Google as the on-the-go Encyclopedia. While everything on the internet is not false, most of the trends and popular opinions often lack scientific backing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some research, we put forward seven health facts that you may have some confusion about. These facts range from various sections like sugar to meal timings. Take a look at these seven facts that you must know about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Skipping breakfast is not the key</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breakfast is one of the most important meals of the day and while many opines that breakfast will help in losing weight and is good for the metabolism, skipping breakfast will do the body more harm than good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Sugar is no good than a cigarette</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sugar is addictive and it is a source of nothing but empty calories. Just how a cigarette causes harm to the body, sugar particularly white sugar does the body no good. Try to reduce your everyday sugar intake and include vegetables and fruits rich in fiber instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Store food in glass containers and not in plastic ones</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glass containers may be fragile and break easily but from the food safety point of view, it is always advisable to store food ingredients in glass containers and not on plastic ones as leaching and reactions occur via plastic containers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Coffee can reduce your depression</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excess coffee consumption is no doubt not advisable but little consumption of coffee on a regular basis has been shown to reduce depression by 20% in a study. The caffeine in coffee has been shown to improve mental wellbeing and mental clarity amongst the subjects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Meal timings are as important as your meal preparation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as it is important to focus on meal planning and preparations, it is equally important to consume meals timely regularly. Irregularities in meal timings can affect health drastically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. The stretching before running may lower endurance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a little warm-up and stretching are practiced before any physical sports activity, stretching before running may lower the stamina and affect endurance. A light warm-up can be done however, stretching before a run is not advisable as stretching relaxes the body and is mostly reserved after completing an activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. It is beneficial to have pumpkin seeds raw</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pumpkin seeds are rich in vitamins and minerals particularly zinc and selenium. It is often used in various preparation or is consumed roasted. It is best to consume pumpkin seeds raw to avail the maximum benefits from the seeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Before following any online trends or opinions, it is best to fact-check from authentic sources and rely on scientific reasoning. We hope to clear some confusion and help you take a step towards healthy living.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Kidney stones are the small, hard deposits of minerals and acid salts that form in the kidney and are often painful when passed. These deposits stick together in concentrated urine and cause pain but usually don\u2019t cause permanent damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stones can form from uric acid which is a by-product of protein metabolism and can also occur when calcium combines with oxalate. If one develops kidney stones, it can be medically diagnosed and there is short-term treatment involved. However, if you want to prevent developing kidney stones in the first place then you need to take care of a few things as listed here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Check your protein consumption</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>High protein diets can lead to increased levels of uric acid and with it the chances of developing kidney stones. Aim for a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Balance your protein intake from both animal and plant sources without overindulging in any.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Increase fluid intake</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking adequate water and healthy fluids is one of the important steps to prevent kidney stones. Have enough water throughout the day and urinate often to get your body rid of excess calcium that may deposit. Have electrolytes and fluids like coconut water, mint water, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Consume appropriate calcium</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calcium is vital for many body processes and its intake through regular food is essential. One should consume adequate calcium to prevent kidney stones. Make sure to consume the recommended amount of calcium for the age group and avoid taking elemental calcium unnecessarily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Reduce sodium</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A high sodium diet is not at all good for the health as it may trigger kidney stones. A diet with low sodium is recommended for preventing kidney stones. Additionally, a diet low in sodium will help in maintaining a healthy heart and plod pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Keep a check on your weight</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping a healthy weight is essential as excess weight will increase the chances of kidney stones. Being overweight or obese will put extra pressure on the kidneys and can contribute to kidney stone formation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Kidney stones are far common and necessary diagnosis and treatments are available too. However, it is best to take care of your kidneys with an appropriate diet and lifestyle early on to avoid incidents of kidney stones.</p>\n",

The sustainable step towards weight management is to take time for the body to adapt to changes and once in a while a change in routine due to traveling, festivals, or occasions is inevitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weight gained overnight is often not the gain in fat and most of it is a temporary issue. It is important to take care of several factors like sleep, work-related stress, improper meal timings, etc., which can affect the digestive system and hormonal regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctor recommends keeping a track of:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The type and combination of foods that you are consuming</li><li>Improper fitness schedule</li><li>Mood and hormonal issues</li><li>Menstrual cycle</li><li>Sleep and meal timings</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Don\u2019t panic if you find you have gained some extra pounds overnight, most often it is a temporary issue the body is facing and is completely normal. Try not to get anxious and avoid weighing every day. Often the weight gain is an increase in muscle weight and not fat. If the weight fluctuations happen often and consistently, do visit your doctor or physician for added guidance.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>The journey towards weight loss is challenging but it doesn\u2019t end on hitting the desired weight. The real challenge lies in maintaining the weight in the long run as data suggests that about only 20 percent of the dieters who start off overweight end up successfully losing weight and maintaining it in the long term. But don\u2019t let this discourage you as we brief you about the maintenance diet and strategies around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why do people regain weight?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unrealistic picture that is presented all around regarding weight-loss strategies is tempting to many and thus, there are few common reasons why people tend to gain back the weight they lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Wrong mindset</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many think of diet as a quick fix rather than a step towards better health in the long run. They tend to give up and go back to old habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Lack of sustainable approach</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast fad diets are focused on immediate results and not on the behavioral change of lifestyle. Often the core reason for the change in habits is not explained and people fail to have a sustainable approach towards weight loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Restrictive diets</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Diets focused on extreme restriction and rigorous calorie counting slows the metabolism and creates an imbalance of hormones, all of it resulting in rapid weight gain soon after losing some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why it does not end at weight loss?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The journey is a long-run process and it does not end after attaining the ideal weight one aimed for. Often people go for \u201ccheat meals\u201d or \u201ccheat habits\u201d as a way to reward themselves after a tough, restrictive week. This approach hinders the body processes that could be avoided with the help of slow and sustainable changes in the habits. Weight loss, after all, is a journey more than a goal and it is important to maintain the weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to maintain weight loss?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Don\u2019t skip breakfast</strong>: eating breakfast helps in maintaining healthy habits better like exercising and having more fiber and micronutrients.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Exercise regularly:</strong> Exercising every day for at least 30 minutes helps in maintaining weight and preventing the accumulation of unnecessary fats.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Be mindful of refined carbs:</strong> be mindful of the carb sources and opt for complex over refined carbs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Don\u2019t overindulge:</strong> break down big meals into smaller ones to avoid overindulgence at a time.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Stick to your plan</strong>: be consistent with your goals and don\u2019t give up.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Make sustainable lifestyle changes</strong>: incorporate small changes in the lifestyle that are easy to maintain every day.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote</strong> Following fast diet trends does the body more harm than good as they seldom have any sustenance in the long run. A sustainable diet is a key to a healthy weight loss that could be maintained in the long run.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Incidents of flu, common cold, infections, sore throats, and fever due to seasonal variations are fairly common and affect everyone once in a while. The instant response has increasingly become to seek a doctor\u2019s prescription of antibiotics or buy them off the counter if everything else fails. The concept of a quick recovery and gulping down strong antibiotics restricts the power of natural healing and in the long run, it comes with grave consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do antibiotics work?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand their mechanism it\u2019s important to understand the two important germs- Bacteria and Viruses.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bacteria &#8211; They are living microorganisms that are present almost everywhere. While most are not harmful, some even being beneficial for the gut health and digestion, few are however the cause of severe infections. They multiply rapidly and can cause several illnesses and infections. Antibiotics are effective against bacteria because they restrict the proliferation of bacteria.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Viruses- They are non-living microorganisms that require a host body to grow and reproduce. While the body\u2019s defense mechanism fights off viruses, colds, and cough if caught has to run down the course. Antibiotics do not work against viruses.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Antibiotic Overdose and its threat</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequent and unnecessary use of antibiotics has an adverse effect on the body. It hinders the body\u2019s ability to fight against microbes and increases the resistance of microbes to antibiotics. Antibiotics kill the bacteria, and the ones it fails to kill proliferate further, and thus next time the antibiotic dose becomes ineffective against the microbe. This results in the continued use of higher dosage which is very harmful to our system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calls antibiotic resistance \u2018one of the world\u2019s most pressing public health problems.\u2019 Bacteria that were once highly receptive to antibiotics have become more and more resistant. Infections like ear infections, sinus, and pneumonia which were easily treatable are now hard to treat due to overdose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another setback of antibiotics is they cannot distinguish between the good and the bad bacteria. This results in the killing of all the bacteria present including the good ones. The good bacteria often found in the gut is very essential for the proper maintenance of the system, depletion of which affects the whole body in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> It is advisable to let milder infections run their course instead of gulping high-dose medicines every time. This will help in strengthening the body\u2019s immunity and fighting ability and prevent antibiotic-resistant germs to divide further. Consult your doctor for proper guidance and avoid taking self-medication every time you feel sick.</p>\n",

Nutrition caters to almost all body ailments and conditions along with workout and fitness regimes. One who is a fitness enthusiast cannot overlook the power of nutrition along with the fitness routine. When both are paired correctly, it can do wonders to the body in the present and the future as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some aspects of fitness nutrition that should be part of your daily life.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> <strong>Power of protein</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Protein is the building block of the body and it is essential to consume a good amount of protein for proper bodybuilding. It is an important macronutrient for building strong bones and muscles as well as for the repair of tissues. Add a good amount of protein from various plants and animal sources like pulses, legumes, quinoa, lean meat, and eggs.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Don\u2019t cut off the carbs</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent diet trends mostly suggest eliminating carbs and showing them in the bad limelight as something harmful that makes you fat. However, carbs are extremely essential for the proper functioning of the body, particularly the digestive system and the gut. It provides energy and bulk for the stools. Swap refined carbs with complex carbs like oats, quinoa, whole wheat, and brown rice for a fitter body.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Rainbow platter</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A plate full of colorful fruits and veggies is essential for a fit body as they contain essential phytochemicals, antioxidants, and nutrients that help protect against diseases and build a strong immune system. Include colorful veggies like pumpkin, carrot, beetroot, and fruits like pomegranates, kiwi, papaya, orange, berries, grapes, etc. in good amounts every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fuel it right</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many feel that exercising on empty stomach first thing in the morning is healthy but it is not. It is very important to provide enough fuel for the exercise else it will only burden the system to overwork and as a result get fatigued. However, it is also important not to exercise right after meals as it can make you sick. Fuel your body right with pre-workout snacks that are light enough like dry fruits, juices, and smoothies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> Incorporating the right nutrition into your fitness regime is very important for prolonged and healthy life. Don\u2019t follow the fad diets blindly as they may have long-term adverse effects. Instead, incorporate these must-haves in your daily fitness routine.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Breastfeeding is an inevitable part of child-rearing and it is more than just supplying nutrients to the baby. The art of breastfeeding and the parameters related to it is quite varied and complex. We intend to break down certain aspects of breastfeeding and put forward how breastfeeding goes beyond nutrition, as something much deeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Breastfeeding promotes bonding</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breastfeeding initiates the bond that a newborn shares with a mother, and a mother with her child. The universal love and affection for one\u2019s child reach a new leap when an infant suckles a mother\u2019s breasts. The process releases several hormones in both mother and child\u2019s body which also determines the depth of the relationship shared by them. The motherly feeling and \u201cthe instincts of a mother\u201d as we call it also unknowingly rises and so does the baby\u2019s attachment with the mother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skin-to-Skin Contact</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than the breast milk that is fed to the child what is important is the physical closeness shared by the mother and the child. One of the most important reasons for the bond is skin-to-skin contact. Studies show that infants who suckle breasts are more attached and close to the mother than those who are bottle-fed. The contact releases oxytocin which increases the bond too. Infants who suckle breast or have skin contact within one hour of birth releases more positive hormones and enhance calming sensation and reduce anxiety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The ABCs of breastfeeding</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three things that will simplify the art of mastering breastfeeding include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Awareness</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important for the mother to be aware and catch the cues that the baby is providing when it wants milk. Initially, it might take some time to catch on cues like bringing hands to mouth, thumping on breasts but upon closely observing it gets easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Being Patient</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Being patient is the key to great nursing as different babies latch and feed for different durations.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Comfort</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking short breaks and sufficient rest is important as it helps to reduce fatigue and help feed comfortably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages of Breastfeeding</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the bonding, there are several advantages for both the mother and baby.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Lifelong health</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Breast milk contains antibodies, anti-allergens, and other immune-boosting components that stay lifelong. It is important for the strong and healthy development of the baby.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cognition</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Adequately breastfed babies show high intelligence and cognitive development as they grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Comfort</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It promotes calming effect and reduces pain as well as gives a sense of security from the vulnerable environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Recognition</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The proximity enables babies to develop scent and voice recognition. This aids in recognition in an unfamiliar environment and seeking comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Improves sleep</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The hormones released during breastfeeding induce good sleep in babies which is very important for good health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> Breastfeeding goes beyond breast milk to provide an eternal and lifelong bond between a mother and the child and develop several emotions of love, affection, closeness, and apathy which are important for years to come. Enjoy the precious phase of breastfeeding and motherhood with your child!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Extensive breastfeeding for at least six months is vital for the proper growth and wellbeing of a newborn as it provides necessary nutrients and antibodies. Lactating mothers must pay extra attention to their diet and lifestyle as it will largely affect the newborn as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research suggests there are some foods like fenugreek seeds, oatmeal, etc., that enhance the lactation process and increase breast milk supply. Consuming nutritious food by the mother is important for a good quality milk supply and likewise, certain foods may adversely affect the contents of breast milk and it is best to avoid those foods. However, it varies from infant to infant how they react to certain odors or flavors. Some may not tolerate spicy or strong-flavored foods like onion, whereas some babies might.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a list of 5 foods that are best to be limited or avoided by lactating mothers.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Caffeine</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Caffeine mostly present in coffee, tea, soda, colas, and chocolates is not recommended for lactating mothers as there is a chance it gets into the breast milk and affects the baby\u2019s health as they can\u2019t metabolize that. Accumulation in the body may result in adverse effects too like irritability and disturbed sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Alcohol</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>During the extensive phase of six months of breastfeeding, it is best to completely avoid drinking alcohol. According to CDC, consuming alcohol can reduce breast milk output by 20 percent. Frequent and excessive alcohol consumption can disrupt sleep patterns, delay psychomotor skills, and delay cognitive development.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Highly Processed Foods</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Highly processed foods are mostly rich in calories and lack nutrients. They also contain additives, colorants, and flavors that are not recommended for breastfeeding mothers as they might affect infants\u2019 health.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Herbal Supplements</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most herbal supplements found in the market don\u2019t have enough research on lactating mothers. Over-the-counter supplements and medicines with health claims are best avoided by breastfeeding mothers. Do read disclaimers before purchasing any such items.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Certain spices</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some babies turn intolerant towards certain spices or herbs in food and it is best not consumed by the mother. Take time and observe the baby&#8217;s reaction and observe their stools. Many spices are adulterated with harmful colors and substances and hence, one must be careful while purchasing. Most babies show unacceptability towards asafetida, saffron, and garlic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> Childbirth and lactation are important phases for a mother and it is best to be extra cautious about one\u2019s diet to avoid adverse effects on the baby. Follow our guidelines and observe your baby carefully to understand what best suits your child.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>How often have you heard parents telling their kids how rabbits don\u2019t wear glasses because they eat carrots? Quite often, right? Well yes, vitamin A deficiency amongst kids is quite common and it has some serious effects on eye and skin health in particular. Most of the vitamin A-rich foods are found in colored vegetables and fruits like spinach, beans, capsicum, broccoli, carrots, pumpkin, papaya, etc. which kids often avoid. It is important that parents don\u2019t give in to their nagging and instead incorporate vitamin A-rich foods in the kid\u2019s diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a list of 5 Vitamin A-rich foods for kids that are nutritious and tasty as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Spinach and kale crackers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>An interesting way to incorporate spinach and kale into the diet is by making them into bite-sized crackers that are easy to munch on as snacks instead of unhealthy chips. Both spinach and kale are loaded with vitamin A and to best retain the nutrients it is advisable to bake or air fry instead of deep-frying them. Add in some herbs and pepper to enhance the taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Carrot walnut cake</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kids love cakes and pastry and what a great way than to have carrot as the main ingredient. Carrot cakes are very tasty and much loved by kids as well. Add in their favorite nuts and sprinkle some cinnamon too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Eggs benedict</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>An egg is rich in vitamin A and is good for eye health. It is also loaded with nutrients like iron and zinc. Make sure not to leave out the yolk and carefully prepare it with bread as an accompaniment. Add salt, pepper, and seasonings as per taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Beet-Carrot-ginger juice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination is a great drink for kids and adults alike. Have it as a mid-meal and ditch carbonated beverages and processed fruit juices for it. Add a bit of lemon juice and serve with shredded ginger for garnishing. It is great for gut health too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Pumpkin Pie</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pumpkin is a great source of carotene, zinc, vitamin C, amongst others which is a great ingredient for a pie as well. It goes well with winter dishes and pumpkin being naturally sweet adds a natural sweet taste to the pie. Add in your favorite spice, whipping cream, and flavor. Have it as a snack or a dessert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong> Other than the tactic to convince kids to have carrots, try these delicious and nutritious recipes rich in vitamin A<a></a>.

      "rendered": "\n<p>The heart is one of the most important organs that keep working round the clock every day to keep us alive. It pumps blood throughout our body tirelessly, supplying all the nutrients and oxygen. Hence, a heart-healthy diet is extremely important to protect the organ from many life-threatening diseases. Managing a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, and low-fat dairy is extremely beneficial for the heart. While many food groups are crucial for the heart, fats generally aren\u2019t seen in a good light. But fats are important for many functional roles and it\u2019s wise to know the heart-healthy fats at a glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Fatty Fish</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Omega fatty acids found in fatty fish are good for the heart and also for the brain. Mackerel, salmon, trout are good sources of omega fats. Fats contained in lean meat like fish are the good ones as compared to the saturated fats found in red meat that are harmful to the heart. Fatty fish should find its place in the staple everyday diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Avocados</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most fruits are low in fat but avocado is all about fats- the good ones! It is rich in MUFA and also antioxidants. Incorporate it in your diet often as a toast, salad, or omelet but be sure not to over-consume it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Olive oil</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Olive oil is a light oil with a low smoke point which makes it great as a dressing and dips, thus retaining its nutrients. It is low on saturated and harmful fats and has a good amount of monounsaturated fatty acids. It also has anti-inflammatory properties thus reducing the risk of heart diseases. Make sure not to use olive oil for deep frying as it has a low smoking point.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Nuts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although nuts are the concentrated sources of fats, they are great for protecting the heart as they contain good amounts of omega fatty acids and vitamin E. They also help in reducing the bad cholesterol and maintain the levels of the good cholesterol, that is, HDL. Add almonds, walnuts, cashews, pecans, and pistachios to your diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote</strong> It is crucial that we take good care of our heart and not burden it with unnecessary things that would put it at risk. Limit the consumption of foods high in cholesterol, saturated fats, trans fat, and sodium, and increase these fats that are good for the heart.</p>\n",

Children with dental problems are far more common as they indulge in candies, chocolates, and everything sweet! Well, you can\u2019t blame them, we all love candies as a kid, is it not? However, without timely care, it can lead to severe plaques, cavities, and gum problems. But worry not, they can relish the delicacies while maintaining good oral hygiene and care by following these simple tips!</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Inculcate early on</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to make kids understand the importance of regular brushing and encourage them to take it up as a habit. Teach them the right way and for sufficient time. Make sure the brush has soft bristles and is gentle. You can play a rhyme on brushing or make them watch their favorite character do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Be a role model</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Children follow their parents in most of the activities and they mostly watch and learn. They love to imitate others and it is the right opportunity to inculcate good values. As parents, you can show them oral hygiene practices and may take them up as a family ritual to brush together. Make it a fun activity so that they don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a compulsion.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Limit certain foods</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to restrain kids from having their favorite candy but make sure not to provide excessive sticky and sugary items especially gummy candy, roll-ups, and candy floss. They stick to the enamel and erode it if not properly washed. Make sure to rinse their mouth after having such foods.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Regular check-up</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents often wait for an issue like plaque, cavity, or pain to occur to visit a dentist, however, it is recommended that one visits a dentist for a regular checkup once or twice a year at the least. A regular checkup can help in detecting dental and gum problems early on and thus reduce complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to You</strong> Make sure your kids take good care of their teeth-be it the milk teeth or the permanent ones and you as role models inculcate it into their everyday lifestyle. Early oral health intervention as a part of a routine is very important to maintain strong and healthy teeth lifelong.</p>\n",

The diet trends are fast-changing and seldom impactful. Most of the trends are focused on the strict regime and short-term results which are not only baseless in the long run but also harmful. One must be careful about the source the information comes from and look for something lifelong and not a fad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sustainability is the way forward</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behavioral change for someone who has been accustomed to an unhealthy way of living is difficult but not impossible. But the main focus should be on understanding the fact that sustainable and healthy weight is the way forward. No matter how much you starve today to fit into your favorite dress, your body will have to repent more than that. Temporarily fixed weight as per short-term needs is hugely burdensome to the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sustainable and healthy approach to weight needs to start early. While the entire beauty industry sets the standard for what\u2019s normal, a real-life scenario isn\u2019t likewise. One needs to understand that irrespective of what and how much you consume, you have a body type that may be different from someone similar to you. The sustainable approach does not restrict or indulge you, rather it is a lifelong habit that begins with a positive approach towards weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Relationship with Food</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food should be enjoyed. It should nourish and protect you. It should not make you feel less or insufficient. A positive body image and accepting that it needs care and not torture is very important. Let the force come from within and guide you towards simple changes like practicing yoga, going for a walk, cutting down on foods you know will be harmful in the long run, controlling portion sizes, staying hydrated, and indulging more in your cultural cuisines and diverse local produce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over to you</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understand that good things take time and the sooner you begin to accept the fact that you need to see your actions from the perspective of a sustainable and long-term impact, the better it is. Your body has its own tune to adapt to things and unhealthy habits are often easy to adapt to and tough to leave. Love yourself and accept yourself for who you are and now how much you weigh. Healthy weight week is observed since January 1994 on every third full week of January. The next healthy weight week begins on Sunday, January 16th, 2022. So, s<a></a>tart preparing the list of things you would do to bring a long-term health impact and love your body a little better!</p>\n",

So it is important to segregate fact and fiction and make wise choices before adopting a weight-loss strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We break down certain myths and help you take a step towards healthy weight management in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 1</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skipping breakfast aids in weight loss</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure it does, but the weight loss is starvation. In the long run, skipping breakfast will lead to severe nutritional deficiency and malnutrition. After a fasting state during the night\u2019s sleep, it is important to break the fast with a well-balanced breakfast. A properly planned breakfast can lead to proper weight management too, you don\u2019t need to deprive your body of food. A healthy breakfast is essential as it supplies essential nutrients to the body and energy to get you through the day. It helps in proper brain functioning and enhances concentration and thereby productivity. Make sure to include a good amount of fiber and vitamin-rich foods in the morning, they would help in managing your weight better. Add healthy smoothies, oatmeal as delicious breakfast bowls!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 2</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Green tea in the morning burns fats</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is probably one of the most believed myths that have no scientific reasoning. Green tea is great for the body no doubt as it has antioxidants and phytochemicals, but it has no role in burning fats. It is better than regular tea as it has retained the nutrients but it is rich in caffeine too. Also, it has anti-nutritional factors in it so if paired with breakfast it hinders absorption of other nutrients. Green tea sure can boost metabolism but has no significant effect on weight loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 3</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Instead of cooked foods, one must consume only raw foods in the morning for weight loss</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many believe that raw foods are more nutritious and healthy and have a great role in weight loss. Although fruits are best when eaten raw over prepared dishes, not all food groups can be eaten raw. Cooked foods are great and easy to digest, it breaks anti-nutrient factors. It gets absorbed in the body easily. Also, cooking foods combines various ingredients which increases the nutritional quotient. The addition of herbs and spices increases metabolism as well as the sensory attributes of foods. Of course, the type of cooking matters as deep-frying surely won\u2019t help, but boiling, grilling, roasting, and baking would!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Footnote</strong> Losing weight in a healthy way is very crucial for the proper functioning of all systems. It is important to know what can harm your body in the long run and to stay away from such strategies. But surely, breakfast can be your best friend in the journey of weight loss when planned right!</p>\n",

As winters are set to begin, it marks a host of modifications in lifestyle and habits. Nonetheless, dietary habits must change too. People are more prone to fall sick during this time of the year and binge eating is most common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also the season when a sedentary lifestyle is on the rise which leads to winter weight gain. Be sure to modify your habits with the change in season to stay fit, healthy, and energized by following these simple tips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Go colorful, seasonal, and local</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter means markets filled with local produce that are so varied and colorful that you won\u2019t run out of recipes. Switch to local and fresh produce of fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; Make sure to have carrots, beetroot, beans, peas, bell peppers, oranges, apples, pomegranate, kiwi, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, and the list is endless. They are rich in antioxidants and vital minerals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Immunity is the key</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cough and cold are very common during winters. Make sure to have food items that boost immunity like vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, zinc, and selenium. Have oranges, kiwi, and strawberries rich in immunity-boosting components. Herbal decoction once a day and including ginger, turmeric in the diet will help keep flu at bay!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Don\u2019t neglect water</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tend to forget to drink enough water during winters due to reduced water loss as sweat. Despite not feeling thirsty, make sure to remain hydrated and drink sufficient water. Avoid carbonated and caffeinated beverages as they tend to make you thirstier. Opt for juices, soups, herbal teas, and decoctions instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Move those legs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lack of activity and laziness is bound to happen during winters but don\u2019t let the weather get the best of you. Follow a regular routine of exercises like walking, jogging cycling, or even playing outdoor games like badminton and tennis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Check your sleep cycle</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tend to feel more sleepy during winters and the cozy blanket weather demands so. However, do check the timings as oversleep can be harmful too. Make sure not to oversleep during naps and keep doing your regular activities to avoid getting into a sedentary lifestyle. A sound night\u2019s sleep is very vital for proper metabolism and renewing energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next?</strong> Bring out your winter clothes, picnic plans and to-do recipes with all the fresh winter produce that nature has to offer while keeping these 5 points in mind to thoroughly enjoy while remaining fit and healthy!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Tired of the same, old, stressful routine and looking for some rejuvenation? Nothing better than pampering oneself with a dose of self-care. While tackling so many responsibilities and chores, we often neglect our skin and its care. Make-up sure can cover up but what skin needs is some care for a healthy, radiant, and supple outlook. Running to the beauty parlor every time might not be feasible. So, here we are listing down steps towards healthy skin that are easy to follow and can be easily part of daily routine!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Small routines make big differences</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Clean-up</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleaning skin properly is very essential for healthy skin. It removes dirt, grease accumulated in pores and reduces the chance of developing pimples and acne. Choose a milk cleanser that suits your skin type best. Once a week go for homemade ubtan that is very effective in having clear skin. Use sandalwood, milk, besan, turmeric as it suits the skin.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Add Vitamin C</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitamin C is an essential component for the formation of collagen and maintaining the elasticity of the skin. Along with consuming Vitamin C-rich fruits, apply some like tomato, papaya to the skin as well. Make sure not to apply lemon juice as it\u2019s too acidic. Use Aloe Vera gel as a face mask and watch your skin brighten.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Exfoliate</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Building up of dead skin and debris makes our skin dull and lifeless. In order to remove them make sure to exfoliate once or twice a week as per your skin type. Exfoliating also helps in increasing blood flow and makes your skin smooth and shiny. Be sure not to overdo it as it will harm your skin. You can use natural exfoliators like coffee and honey and wash them off gently.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Moisturize</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An important stem not to be missed as the skin needs to retain its suppleness by applying adequate moisturizer. Choose moisturizer as per your skin type and weather. During summers opt for light moisturizers and winters try creamy ones. It will nourish your skin and prevent skin from breaking. Try a homemade moisturizer by adding aloe vera gel or vitamin E and coconut oil. Many use milk as a natural moisturizer too.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Night care</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, not to forget the important step most people often neglect- Night care! Nighttime during sleep is the most vital time for skin to restore its goodness. Hence, it is extremely important to take care of skin at night. Make sure to remove all makeup before bedtime and apply a good night cream. Apply face mask at night once a week followed by adequate moisturizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next?</strong> Don\u2019t forget to stay hydrated and have a sound sleep along with eating plenty of fruits and veggies for all the mentioned beauty routines to have optimum effect on your skin and get radiant, healthy, and nourished skin all year round!</p>\n",

Many people suffer from bloating and poor digestive health during a flight and it&#8217;s worse if the journey is long. That\u2019s no way to land on your important meeting or a much-awaited trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can\u2019t often control the external environment, you can easily maintain your internal system so that you have sound travel no matter how long it is. Make sure to follow our tips for the pre-flight meal for a pleasant experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Do\u2019s</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Hydrate with herbs</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with your regular water have an herbal infusion which is great to maintain the digestive system. Have mint lemonade, floral or herbal teas instead of caffeinated and cola beverages.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fruity yogurt won\u2019t hurt</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yogurt is great for the gut we all know that. It is even great when paired with fruits and berries. It is a light pre-flight snack or a post-lunch dessert that maintains your gut and prevents flatulence. Also, it tastes great!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fill with protein that\u2019s lean</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid heavy foods rich in unhealthy fats and oils. Instead, restore to lean meat that keeps you full without making you sick. Have it steamed, baked, or grilled for better nutrients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Don\u2019ts</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>No to sodium</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Refrain from consuming sodium-rich foods like fried foods, pizza, French fries, etc. They are super unhealthy and result in water retention and a bloated feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cheesy ain\u2019t good</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheesy foods can make you greasy inside which will disrupt your digestion process and may even lead to vomiting. It\u2019s better to keep your stomach light before a flight.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Say no to Colas</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbonated beverages like colas are dehydrating and make your stomach and gastric issues rise. Say no to colas before a flight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote</strong> Have a light meal or snack before a flight. Having a heavy meal rich in greasy food and unhealthy fats will worsen your digestive health and make your journey uncomfortable. Make sure to visit the loo before a flight. Grab those tips and have a pleasant trip!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>It\u2019s a nightmare of every parent to give in to the<a></a> nagging of their kids for junk foods, and what\u2019s worse is if parents indulge in junk food regularly too! The entire food industry is focused on the business at the cost of human health and especially targeting children because they are easy to attract. Every day shelves are bombarded with new products, new varieties, and new flavors of junk foods. They are attractive, tasty convenient, and often cheaper than healthier options. But in the long run, they come with the added cost of ill-health and disorders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend of junk foods has given rise to obesity remarkably among adults as well as children. Children often learn from their parents and if they can\u2019t inculcate the good habits, they definitely pick on the bad ones. Junk foods are bad for a number of reasons. They are,</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>High in unhealthy and empty calories</li><li>High in salt content</li><li>High in sugar content</li><li>High in unhealthy fats</li><li>Addictive</li><li>Low in satiety</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the red flags, we often indulge in junk foods once in a while. Although we can control our urges and make constructive decisions, children are often unaware and na\u00efve about the consequences of consuming them. Before finding ways to stop or control, it is essential to understand the reasons why children cannot stop indulging in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fast-paced life</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With both working parents on the rise and a fast pace life along with it, outside food is more common and readily available than cooking at home. It is easy to pace nagging kids with a pack of chips or a bar of chocolate than resorting to healthier alternatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Addictive</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Truth be told, junk foods are addictive. Often they don\u2019t fill your stomach but bring in a feel-good feeling. It results in over-indulgence and results in a host of health complications. They are high in salt and sugar along with artificial flavors which make them addictive.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Monotonous food</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Children are often picky eaters and they avoid home-cooked food which they find boring and monotonous. Eating healthy and the way of life is boring for them and hence they grab on bites of junk food which tastes better and looks appealing.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Peer pressure</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Often kids influence kids into bad habits by choosing unhealthy alternatives. They are not mature enough to take wise steps hence fall prey to peer pressure and bullying easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Attractive Ads</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Appealing and attractive ads on TV and social media are targeted towards children. They end up demanding unhealthy junk food that gets newly launched and is adamant enough for parents to give in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote</strong> While it\u2019s important to find solutions, it is equally crucial to understand the cause behind such poor eating habits of the children. Take time and analyze the physiological and psychological aspects of kids indulging in junk to take definite steps to curb it.</p>\n",

Its health is very important for the proper functioning of the entire system. A single glitch in brain functioning can affect multiple body processes and manifest in terms of physiological and psychological malfunctioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of the aspect of brain health is developed as a fetus, it is essential to focus on brain health since the start to avoid the future manifestation of issues from developing. Neurological disorders are a broad term and have various causes, complications, and symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pediatric population manifests many neurological defects and disorders including autism, cerebral palsy, brain injury, etc. Hence careful diet and adequate nutrients are important for both a pregnant mother as well as children in their early years. Following are some nutrients that need more attention:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Omega fatty acids</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>PUFA and MUFA including omega 3 and 6 fatty acids are vital for brain health. It is essential for cognitive development, memory, and proper neurological transmission. They are found in fish oils, walnuts, almonds, chia seeds, and flax seeds to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Zinc</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Zinc is essential for spinal development and avoiding neurological tube defects and stillbirths. Include a good amount of seafood including shellfish, oysters along with vegetables.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Folate</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Folate and folic acid are crucial for brain health. It is an important nutrient in several neurotransmission processes. Include a good amount of green vegetables, chickpeas, and nuts in your diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Vitamin B12</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps in repairing nerve damage and maintaining healthy tissues. Its deficiency can affect the system largely. Make sure to include meat, liver, eggs, and dairy in your diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Vitamin K</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitamin K is rarely found in diet but is very important for various brain functions. It is essential in blood clotting processes too. Include vegetables, mushrooms, and Alfa Alfa in your diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Choline</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Choline is found in eggs, peanuts, and spinach. It is essential for the release of acetylcholine which carries signals in the brain and is important for its proper functioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote</strong> Diet focused on brain health is crucial for a healthy fetus and a healthy growing baby. It is essential to include these vital nutrients as early as possible to avoid future complications. Make sure right from a pregnant mother to the growing child, these nutrients find their place on the plates.</p>\n",

There are several contradictions in matters concerning the lactation phase and breastfeeding over the internet, word of mouth, and various print media. Here we bring you certain myths and debunk them to bring clarity and ease out your journey of breastfeeding your newborn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 1</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><u>You must eat bland food during breastfeeding</u></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth Busted:</strong> Foods take time to be digested and broken down. Ginger, garlic, and other flavorful spices in the diet won\u2019t affect the quality of milk. It is essential to add herbs and spices to the diet but in moderate amounts. Some items might be having allergic components and it&#8217;s best advised to avoid colorants and additives but a bland diet is not at all recommended during breastfeeding. Keep a food diary and see how the baby reacts after you consume certain ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 2</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><u>You need to feed every 2 hours round the clock for sufficient food for baby</u></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth Busted</strong>: requirements of babies vary and so does the lactation of mothers. Most newborns need to be fed every two hours, however, rather than focusing on the clock, focus on the instinct and response of the baby. If you are worried about the baby not consuming enough, keep a track of dirty diapers and the weight of the baby. Consult a pediatrician to diagnose your baby better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 3</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><u>If you are sick, you must not breastfeed</u></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth Busted:</strong> The situation varies with the type of illness. Most mothers can breastfeed during a mild illness, however, in case of heavy medications and drugs, chances are residues might travel to babies so it\u2019s best to consult your doctor on the nature of your illness. Other than that antibodies created in the mother\u2019s body benefit the babies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 4</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><u>Medications need to be avoided during breastfeeding</u></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth Busted:</strong> It is important to convey to your doctor that you are a breastfeeding mother so that doctor can adjust the type of medications and dosage accordingly. Doctors can also guide according to the type of medication if it\u2019s suitable for breastfeeding and adjust the timings. Also, it is possible to pump milk beforehand and take the medicines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth 5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><u>You have to \u201cPump and Dump\u201d after you drink alcohol</u></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myth Busted:</strong> As a responsible mother, it is best to avoid alcohol during breastfeeding to avoid any adverse effects on the baby. If at all one feels consuming alcohol, it is better to wait 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding duration and also check on the quantity of alcohol. Wait for at least 3 hours before feeding again after alcohol consumption or you may as well pump milk for the baby prior. However, make sure to not waste quality milk production and put the baby\u2019s health at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote</strong> Don\u2019t fall under the gigantic pile of myths and misconceptions instead make sure to make an informed choice and be aware of scientific reasoning. Try consulting your doctor and nutritionist to cater to your personalized issue.</p>\n",

Often breastfeeding mothers juggle a lot of things together, be it work-life, responsibilities at home, and the added attention of a newborn which includes a lot many tasks. Mothers often lack sufficient sleep and energy while handling all the responsibilities and meals are often in jeopardy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is very crucial for lactating mothers to pay close attention to nutrition and diet so that sufficient nutrients are available for both the mother and the baby. It is as much important to take of oneself as the baby since the baby derives the nutrients through breast milk and the mother needs an increased amount of certain nutrients to replenish the stored reserves and for proper breast milk production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips and guidelines for the nutrition of lactating mothers and their babies:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water along with healthy drinks like buttermilk, juices, smoothies, and shakes, etc. Refrain from consuming alcohol, carbonated beverages, and caffeinated drinks.</li><li>Include good amounts of whole grains, millets like ragi, jowar, bajra, amaranth, and include oatmeal once in a while. Restrict too much consumption of refined cereals.</li><li>Eat sufficient amounts of vegetables, including leafy greens and yellow vegetables like pumpkin.</li><li>Include at least two whole fruits per day. They are rich in antioxidants and phytochemicals.</li><li>Increase your consumption of zinc and iron. Check for your hemoglobin levels and if you are following a vegetarian diet, make sure to include Vitamin B12 supplements, after consulting with your doctor.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Essential nutrients that need to be focused on:</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Carbohydrate</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Increase the consumption of complex carbohydrates to meet the increased energy requirements during the lactation phase. Incorporate whole grains and cereals, fiber-rich vegetables, and a good amount of fruits.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Protein</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Proteins including essential amino acids are essential for lactating mothers.

The line that divides the perception of being healthy and obese is often fine and blurred. New to the bandwagon are the rising cases of childhood obesity. Parents and relatives tend to overfeed children with the notion that it\u2019s good to be fed more. But does it get too late before they realize they turn kids obese instead?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Childhood obesity is rising remarkably and many factors are leading to it.

Others turn obese due to various lifestyle choices and the surroundings one grows up in. Data shows childhood obesity is largely prevalent in urban cities with easy access to junk foods, a fast-paced lifestyle, and poor daily habits. Often working parents don\u2019t pay enough attention to diet and prefer outside food over home-cooked ones. Children are heavily attracted to the junk foods targeted at them and parents often comply with their nagging. On top of it, if parents themselves lack discipline and indulges in an unhealthy lifestyle, children are bound to see and follow that. Children often hide from their parents and consume unhealthy fast food if they are prevented from consuming them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a lack of playtime and outdoor games, having a sedentary lifestyle with increased screen time, children are bound to develop obesity early on. Parents fail to inculcate healthy values in children and refuse to acknowledge the problem of obesity by objecting with the excuse of body positivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to tackle childhood obesity?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s never too late to realize the root issue and take preventive and corrective actions to tackle it. Here are some pointers,</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Consume home-cooked meals</li><li>Check portion control and teach children to understand their appetite and to respect that</li><li>Avoid overfeeding</li><li>Include simple healthy choices</li><li>Make them play outdoors</li><li>Check their screen time</li><li>Keep distractions away during eating</li><li>Let them contribute in the kitchen</li><li>Explain the downsides of processed and packed junk foods</li><li>Exercise together</li><li>Keep healthy snacks handy</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote</strong> It is important to tackle childhood obesity early on to avoid future complications of serious health issues. It is never too late to inculcate a healthy lifestyle. Do consult a doctor to diagnose any associated health complications.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>The topic of Fertility and childbirth is often surrounded largely around women and maternal health. In the process nutrition surrounding the fertility of men is often overlooked. Difficulty in conceiving a child can be directly associated with diet and lifestyle which impact the potency of sperm. Research shows poor dietary habits, smoking and alcoholism can lower the quality and quantity of sperm. Increase your chance of conceiving by developing good dietary habits and lifestyles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Terminologies</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Reduced sperm count</li><li>Abnormal sperm morphology</li><li>Semen volume</li><li>Slow sperm motility</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nutritional guidelines:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Restrain from eating heavily fried junk items, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Foods rich in trans fats are directly related to lower sperm count. According to studies, a diet rich in omega fatty acids, nuts, whole grains, and vegetables are good for healthy sperm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nutrients that help in boosting sperm count:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Zinc</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Infertile men tend to have lower zinc levels compared to fertile men. Zinc helps in regulating both sperm count and quality. Include seafood, oysters in the diet along with various nuts, beans, and whole grains.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Vitamin E</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitamin E is an important antioxidant that helps in maintaining the reproductive system both in men and women. It helps in protecting the sperms from damage. Consume almonds, walnuts, and plant-based oils and seeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Folic Acid</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Folic acid is very vital for fertility in both men and women as well as child health. Studies show men with low folic acid face difficulty in conceiving. Have adequate green leafy vegetables like spinach, asparagus, and a variety of fruits and dairy products. An egg is an important source too.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>D-aspartic acid</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This amino acid regulates the male sex hormone testosterone. Include egg, low-fat milk, oats, yogurt, and dried fruits in your diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>L-arginine</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This amino acid is vital for sperm functioning. However high doses can be harmful hence it&#8217;s better to consult your physician before taking supplements. Try adding a few pumpkin seeds and peanuts to your diet every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote</strong> Start adopting a healthy lifestyle early on to avoid any future complications and when it comes to conceiving men needs to be careful as much as women do. Quit smoking and alcohol consumption and follow these nutritional guidelines. Consult your doctor for added guidance as it is never too late to seek medical advice.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Sugar may taste sweet but it isn\u2019t a sweet treat for many. People struggling with diabetes and obesity, with a strict diet regime often have this particular food category under restriction. Is sugar just the white sugar we all know of? Certainly not! Sugar is a type of carbohydrate which is naturally found not just in sugar cane, but in all fruits as fruit sugar. White sugar is the refined byproduct of sugar cane. We can also find the sweetness of sugar in various forms like the unrefined form, brown sugar, jaggery, molasses, honey, malt, etc. Some of them are rich in minerals, fiber and holds medicinal properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Does any link exist between sugar and cancer?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excessive consumption of sugar has been associated with various health hazards like</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Obesity</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Tooth decay</li><li>Dementia</li><li>Cardiovascular diseases</li><li>Kidney disorders</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, no direct link has been found that sugar consumption leads to cancer or aggravates it. The conception is that cancer cells require energy in form of glucose to survive, grow and multiply. By cutting down sugar, cancer cells won\u2019t be able to survive. But this is untrue since all our cells require glucose to synthesis ATP as energy and our brain can only work on glucose. There is no way for the body to supply glucose to healthy cells leaving the cancer cells out. Hence, a sugar-free diet can\u2019t practically revert or prevent cancer although high consumption is not recommended at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why worry about sugar?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sugar can be the secondary cause of cancer as its higher consumption directly affects various body functions. One must always keep it in moderation and from healthier sources. Obesity increases the chance of developing cancer as adipokines released by fat cells can damage DNA and cause tumors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What should be done?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Control source</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Consume complex carbs and avoid refined products. Look for white sugar substitutes and consume foods with a low glycemic index.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Control portion</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure not to overindulge in sweet items. Sweet products increase our cravings and addiction. Hence, proper balance is necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Add more fiber</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both soluble and insoluble fibers are essential for proper metabolism, satiety control, and gut health. It regulates sugar better.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Stay hydrated</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydration is very important to keep blood sugar in check and kidneys healthy. Drink adequate water and refrain from sugary, carbonated beverages.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Manage stress levels</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Often depression, anxiety, and stress result in a craving for sweet products. It results in overeating, mostly unhealthy items. Keep your stress levels in check and engage in meditation and exercise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote</strong> While the direct association is not there between sugar and cancer but overconsumption of sugar especially refined ones is hazardous to health. Follow the mentioned guidelines and stay healthy.</p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "\n<p>In recent times, people\u2019s perception of food has changed largely. It has transformed from something that is a source of happiness and nourishment to barely either being a necessity or something that is directly related to putting on weight. In these times when the health industry is fast evolving, one must take care that food is not being related as something negative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One\u2019s self-esteem and eating habits are highly related to what one perceives around. Often we hear how having a pizza is a \u201ccheat meal\u201d or someone even avoiding a piece of birthday cake thinking it is going to contribute to weight gain. Some people even go for feasting followed by rigorous fasting with a sense of guilt towards feasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food is meant to be enjoyed, and not seen as a punishment. It is okay to indulge in favorite foods as it gives a sense of positivity and happiness. Outlook towards food can be changed positively and we list few tips for the same!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Distribute in different mealtime</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Denying oneself of pleasure out of favorite food and then indulging should not be seen as a guilty pleasure. Often we end up consuming a lot together just to cater to the cravings we denied so long. This will suddenly burden your system. Instead proportionate it into different meal timings, like instead of finishing a sundae jar together keep some for the next day to relish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Bring on a positive mindset while eating</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on what you are eating and avoid distractions like gadgets and television. This way you can focus and chew properly, sense the food better and eat calmly. Food is meant to be enjoyed with a positive mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Choose better</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often tasty foods are unhealthy loaded with fats and oils. However, there is always a choice to decide better. If you like cookies, pastries, or burgers, there is no harm in having them once in a while. If you are too tense, you can try cooking yourself as it will bring a great sense of happiness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Take it easy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need not be so hard on yourself for having a piece of muffin and train tirelessly. There is no need to punish yourself for eating something you love. Once you bring in a positive outlook towards food, it will help in better functioning of the body too as our mind is very much related to everything that is going on in the body. Plan out your meals better and don\u2019t force-feed just because you read somewhere it\u2019s healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote</strong> Having a positive approach towards food is very essential. One must not be too hard on oneself, instead, go easy and enjoy the food, after all, food is meant to be loved and consumed.</p>\n",

The other end of the spectrum however lies the underweight which is equally a matter of concern. Being underweight does not necessarily result from a lack of food or inadequate food. Rather, the matter of concern is much deeper concerning absorption and utilization of nutrients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s easy to gain weight by unhealthy means, it is not feasible in the long run as they bring forth series of health complications and one might find himself in the loop of health and lifestyle disorders.

      "rendered": "\n<p>A menstrual cycle is calculated from the first day of a period to the first day of the next which on average is 28 days. This number however varies from month to month and woman to woman. It is considered regular if periods happen every 21 to 35 days. Many women are distraught with irregular periods which can be a result of either underlying health conditions or lifestyle changes and hormonal imbalances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To treat such irregularities, cause identification is very vital. Keep a check on your weight pattern, sleep cycle, and eating habits. A good way to keep track is to maintain a period journal where mentioning symptoms, flows, health conditions during periods, etc. can help in identifying the cause better. In medical terminology, Oligomenorrhea is used to define the condition of infrequent menstrual periods and is quite common amongst women.

Take few minutes of the day and try to calm your senses with yoga and meditation.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cumin can cure</strong>&#8211; Found in every household, this little spice can help in regulating irregular periods. It is said that cumin has nutrients that aid in contracting uterine muscles. In a cup of water soak 2 teaspoons of cumin overnight and drink the decoction on waking up in the morning regularly instead of caffeinated beverages.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Ginger has it</strong>&#8211; Gingerol present in ginger help in lowering inflammation and maintaining hormonal balance. It has many other health benefits too against a host of diseases. Include ginger in your everyday diet while cooking or simply sip tulsi ginger tea with a bit of honey.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Piece of pineapple a day</strong>&#8211; Pineapple has an enzyme called Bromelain which helps in easing pain, has anti-inflammatory properties. It also helps in the proper flow of blood and blood circulation.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cinnamon the savior</strong>&#8211; The aromatic spice present in almost every kitchen is a holy grail loaded with health benefits. It helps in regulating hormones and blood flow to the uterus. It relieves menstrual cramps, abdominal pain, and digestive issues amongst many other health benefits. Incorporate it in delicious recipes or simply have it by adding to a glass of milk before bedtime</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many women with underlying conditions of PCOS experience irregular periods too. It is best to consult your doctor if the symptoms are too severe and the irregularities are persistent. Adjust your routine to a healthy lifestyle balancing sleep, dietary habits, and exercise.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>A drastic change in lifestyle over the recent years has contributed to the rise in weight problems in children. Parents often think that being fat as a kid is healthy and that they are nourished well, with little knowledge about the recommended requirements as per age groups. Unhealthy weight gained during childhood goes into contributing to adult obesity and with it several underlying health conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The food industry is bombarded with unhealthy products that are lucrative enough to target children. Lack of physical activities, increased screen-time, sedentary lifestyle, consumption of junk food are some of the many factors that have contributed to childhood obesity. Dieting is not the only option to tackle this and hence an overall approach should be in place. Here is a list of 7 ways in which you can manage weight problems in kids before it\u2019s too late:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Make Healthy Swap</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin by replacing unhealthy snacks like fried and packaged items loaded with salt, sugar, and fats with healthy options like baked veg sticks, roasted pulses, fruit salads, yogurt, nuts, and seeds trail mixes, etc. Ensure that they consume more balanced, home-cooked foods. Unhealthy foods will only increase their cravings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Keep child-sized portions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many times parents end up overfeeding a child by making them eat adult-like portions. Every child&#8217;s requirements are different, so keep a check on the portion size. Include frequent small meals rather than few heavy meals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Avoid distractions during eating</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure your child focuses on what they are eating and is not distracted by watching TV or gazing at phone screens. Often the child will end up eating far more or less than what is required. Make them enjoy eating and not perceive it as a duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Avoid introducing junk food</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t fall for marketing gimmicks targeting children to consume products like chips, carbonated drinks, chocolates, etc. Control their urges and don\u2019t give in easily to their demands. Junk foods are loaded with trans-fat, sugar, and salt which will lead to long-term health complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Engage in physical activities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adequate physical activity is important for proper growth, strong bones, building immunity, regulating mood, and maintaining a healthy weight. No matter how addictive video games and sedentary pass times are, make sure they are socializing and playing outdoor games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Ensure adequate sleep</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A night of good sleep is essential for proper metabolism and regulating appetite. Children need more restful sleep but make sure they don\u2019t oversleep. A proper sleep cycle is also essential so make sure they aren\u2019t up until late with recreational activities or studying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Inculcate healthy decisions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making them understand the importance of healthy habits at an early age. Good parenting techniques in inculcating healthy habits will result in behavioral change in children even when not under supervision. They would as a result control urges and not give in to peer pressures. Start managing your child\u2019s weight early by slowly inculcating healthy practices and reversing bad ones. Consult your pediatrician and nutritionist for a customized approach to managing your child\u2019s health.</p>\n",

Do they really provide energy?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy drinks are seldom healthy. They are very different from health drinks. They contain caffeine and other stimulants, along with sugar. The caffeine and other stimulants in it mimics and fools or nervous system to stay alert and energetic. They are loaded with calories too in the name of energy. If they are sugar-less, they are loaded with artificial sweeteners, colorants, and flavors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are not long-lasting and gives a momentary feeling of being alert and energetic which soon fades away. From a nutritional point of view, they aren\u2019t at all favorable. In fact, the ingredients are mostly addictive. They make the body dehydrated soon after and are not good for distance running. It is also not recommended for children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caffeine and additives in energy drinks can be a health hazard in the long run and they do little benefit to the body. Such stimulants may give an energetic feel before a match but will soon drain you out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are sports drinks meant for all sportsperson?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sports drinks are comparatively healthier as they contain carbohydrates, electrolytes, and added minerals like sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium which are often lost in sweat. They provide instant replenishment of balanced nutrients to the body during exercise, intense workouts, or playing sports. They don\u2019t cause GI distress as fizzy drinks do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sports drinks however are not for ordinary people with a moderate or sedentary lifestyle. It is designed to cater to the needs of sportsperson who engage in intense activity and games on a regular basis. Adults and children can engage in sports drinks in moderation once in a while but not regularly. The best way to stay hydrated is to drink water and fizz-free drinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote</strong> Energy drinks are loaded with stimulants that give momentary effects whereas sports drinks are designed to cater to intense activity needs. Read product labels and make a conscious choice before buying.</p>\n",

The cases of diabetes are on the rise each year, and it is something that can\u2019t be cured but only can be managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is diabetes mellitus?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that prevents the body to utilize glucose partially or completely. This is manifested by increased blood glucose concentration and effect in metabolism of all macronutrients namely protein, fat, and carbohydrate. This can be due to the failure of the formation of insulin or its failure of its action. This results in a host of interrelated issues and complications affecting body tissues, retina, infections, nephropathy, and heart disease to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the types?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Type-1 diabetes</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also called juvenile diabetes as it affects the younger population. It is an autoimmune disease as the immune system is attacked which destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. As a result individuals with type one diabetes needs insulin therapy throughout life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Type-2 diabetes</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is by far the most common type of diabetes which affects adults. It is due to the impairment of the action of insulin as the body becomes resistant to it. This is caused due to various genetic and lifestyle factors and being obese living a sedentary life increases its risk manifold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Gestational diabetes</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It occurs to women during pregnancy and their chance to develop into type-2 diabetes increases if they have gestational diabetes. Make sure to routinely check, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the risk factors?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Genetics: the risk of having diabetes increases if someone in the family has diabetes or is present in the genes.</li><li>Race: Asians are more predisposed towards having diabetes than any other race.</li><li>Age: Male above 40 years and females above 45 years of age are at higher risk.</li><li>Lifestyle: a sedentary lifestyle, acute stress levels, having high blood pressure and obesity are several contributing factors to develop diabetes. It is very essential to have a healthy lifestyle to prevent the onset of diabetes.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the signs and symptoms?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Hyperglycemia</li><li>Polydipsia (increased thirst)</li><li>Polyuria (frequent urination)</li><li>Polyphagia (increased hunger)</li><li>Tiredness and fatigue</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dietary Guidelines</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diet is very vital for the management of diabetes and proper guidance goes a long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Consume high fiber foods and include fruits with peels.</li><li>Consume foods with a low glycemic index that doesn\u2019t shoot up blood glucose levels.</li><li>Include non-starchy vegetables and have loads of green leafy vegetables like spinach, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, and cabbage.</li><li>Replace white rice with brown rice, barley, oats, and quinoa.</li><li>Refrain consuming processed and refined products.</li><li>Include water and antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining your sugar control is essential along with regular exercise and sleep patterns.

It is like a slow killer which progresses slowly and never becomes clinically evident until it\u2019s too late. It needs to be treated at the earliest to prevent it from spreading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for the following symptoms:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Hematuria</li><li>Frequent urination</li><li>Dysuria</li><li>Difficulty in urination</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Diet plays an important role in managing prostate cancer and it is essential to follow a personalized diet to help manage it. Research studies have revealed that a low fat, plant-based diet is particularly beneficial along with avoidance of processed meats, red meats, and high-fat items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a list of 5 dietary guidelines to get you through:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Include fish in your diet:</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Increase intake of fresh fish rich in omega 3 fatty acids and protein. It is very helpful in managing prostate cancer. Include fish like salmon, trout, mackerel about 2-3 times a week. But make sure not to consume it fried, instead have it baked, steamed, or grilled.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fruits rich in antioxidants and cruciferous vegetables needs to be increased:</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporate a variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet and make sure to have a variety of colored ones like berries, plums, grapes, and pomegranates. Include cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli. The pigments present in them are very essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Limit your sugar consumption:</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Say no to highly processed and refined items like cola, sugary sweets, pastries, fried foods, etc. increase your fiber intake and keep your blood glucose level in check. Replace white sugar with jaggery, or date palm. Try to consume naturally sweet products like fruits. Avoid store-bought juices.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Avoid high-fat foods:</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumption of little fat is vital for the proper functioning of the body but avoid high-fat foods as it will create an imbalance and increase your weight. Maintain your weight and consume healthy fats. Keep a check on your cooking oil too and avoid cheese, butter and opt for healthier alternatives like olive oil.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Keep animal protein in check:</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Be careful with animal proteins especially red meat, dairy, and animal fat as they are directly associated with prostate cancer. Avoid processed meat completely like sausage and salami. Switch to a plant-based protein like flax seeds and fibrous beans and nuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote:</strong> Practice all the points mentioned above routinely and inculcate them for healthier choices. For a personalized approach, it is best to consult your dietician.</p>\n",

Associated with it is the fear of spotting, sudden onset of periods unprepared, PMS, cramps, menstrual hygiene, and the confusion regarding which product to use- pads, tampons, or cups?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most women are used to using pads and tampons and the market is flooded with it despite many women facing discomfort, leakage and are environmentally burdening. Recently, menstrual cups are in the spotlight for a variety of reasons. Despite being in the market since the 1930s, it gained momentum recently due to conscious consumer choices being on the rise. Many women are now shifting from pads and tampons to cups and it&#8217;s liberating! Here\u2019s all you need to know about menstrual cups!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What exactly is a menstrual cup?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A menstrual cup is a small, funnel-shaped flexible cup made up of safe rubber or silicone which gives better hygiene and protection by collecting the blood and fluids. It is designed in a way that it can be easily inserted and taken out. They come in different sizes and capacities as per the size of the vagina and flow of menstrual blood. These cups hold more blood than tampons and pads. They can be worn for a longer duration of up to 12 hours without any issue and don\u2019t lead to spotting or leakage. And the best part of it is they are reusable, cost-effective, and environment-friendly!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menstrual cups being small and flexible are designed in a way to collect the menstrual flow and fluids from the spot where it releases, thus it does not disturb the urine flow. It can be bent and inserted just like a tampon. One needs to take care of the size for proper results as too large or too small can be uncomfortable. Once it is inserted, it can collect and keep the blood for hours. It can then be easily taken out with the help of a protruding outlet and blood can be discarded. Menstrual cups don\u2019t absorb or soak blood, instead, it collects the blood. The cups thus can be washed well and reused. You may also discard it after one cycle, however, it can safely be used for multiple cycles. You can sterilize in boiling water but make sure to follow the instructions mentioned on the pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pay attention to the size!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The size of menstrual cups is very important. Make sure to check the range of a brand to understand the best fit. Correct size is important to fit in right and to hold in the blood properly. There are certain factors that you can take care of before deciding on the size:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Age</li><li>Length of cervix</li><li>Flow rate and amount</li><li>Firmness and flexibility of cup</li><li>The capacity of cup</li><li>History of Vaginal birth</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Comparative chart<a></a>:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pros of menstrual cups</strong></td><td><strong>Cons of menstrual cups</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Environment-friendly option.

      "rendered": "\n<p>The Covid pandemic has brought a great shift in the work culture with work from home being immensely popular across companies. Be it anywhere, productivity at work is very important to meet targets and deadlines. Keeping up the morale and focusing on healthy choices is very important, not only to meet short-term goals but to also keep good health in the long run- both physically and mentally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a list of health hacks that would boost your workplace productivity and prevent you from getting exhausted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Healthy steps</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is always a choice whether to take the lift or climb the stairs. Make sure to manage time well and take the steps instead of that crowded lifts. Of course, during emergencies lifts are a viable option but by being punctual, you can exercise those legs by taking the stairs, calmly and slowly. The stress associated with the \u201crush\u201d can be damaging mentally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Maintain your meals</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cutting short the nibbling habit while working and instead focusing on eating a good home-cooked meal is essential to maintain good health in the long run. Avoid consumption of too much junk and fried foods and instead, have a healthy breakfast and lunch at work. Also, be careful about the portion size as heavy meals lead to sleepy and lazy feelings, thereby reducing productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Remember to stretch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting for hours and gazing at the screen can be disastrous to the entire body and not just posture or eyes. Make sure to do eye exercise every half hour and get up, stretch and walk a bit frequently to avoid exhaustion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Snack wisely</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrying healthy snacks like nuts and seed trails, granola nutrition bars, fruits, and roasted pulses is a great way to maintain health and prevent overeating. Healthy snacking helps to keep the brain sharp and alert hence lets you focus better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Stay hydrated</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adequate water consumption is very important as it helps us to remain alert, focused, and healthy. Make sure to refill water bottles and consume them in a relaxed mind. Have seasonal fruit and vegetable juices too to remain hydrated and supply essential electrolytes. Choose coconut water over carbonated beverages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Plan it out</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a proper plan to start the day and diving the time accordingly not only helps in meeting targets better but also helps in having a relaxed mind and finishing tasks ahead of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnote</strong> Add sticky notes, manage time by sorting tasks and follow these simple tips to enhance your productivity which will help in maintaining a good work and personal life balance.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Are you witnessing grey hair at a young age? Is premature greying of hair related to diet? Can pre-mature greying of hair be delayed by watching what you consume? There are endless questions regarding premature graying of hair as it is becoming very common in the younger population, including children and teens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graying of hair prematurely doesn\u2019t pose any harm directly however there may be several underlying conditions and deficiencies that are manifested with premature greying of hair. There may be several reasons associated with it- it may be genetic or due to psychological stress too. Before addressing how to overcome the problem, let\u2019s look into some of the root causes of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What could be the reasons?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Genetic</strong>&#8211; Just how baldness appears suddenly as one grows up due to genetic factors, premature graying of hair too could be genetic. If parents and grandparents faced a similar condition, likely, you are genetically predisposed to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Stress</strong>&#8211; with a lifestyle change, extreme stress is on the rise. It has resulted in early greying of hair, together with environmental stress loaded with pollutants. Both psychological and environmental stress can be one of the reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Anemia</strong>&#8211; Anemia which is common in women, is associated with the early onset of grey hair. Iron deficiency is also associated with fatigue and lethargy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.<strong> Unhealthy eating pattern</strong>&#8211; Young population loves junk food and highly processed food items. They bring forth loads of health issues, graying of hair being one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the root issue is found out, work towards it as it is impossible to reverse graying of hair. Very little could be done for genetic issues however a close watch on diet pattern and lifestyle is essential to delay it as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips to tackle premature greying of hair:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Cut down on junk foods</strong> and carbonated beverages. Highly processed packaged foods needs to be avoided too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Incorporate fiber-rich, antioxidants-rich foods</strong> as they counter the free radicals. Include loads of colored fruits and vegetables in your diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3<strong>. Increase protein intake</strong> as they help in maintaining healthy hair growth. Include loads of plant proteins as well proteins from non-vegetarian sources like eggs and lean meat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4<strong>. Iron and Vitamin B12 </strong>need to be included in the diet and include loads of seeds, dates, green leafy vegetables, bananas, etc. They are vital for healthy hair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Practice <strong>yoga, meditation</strong> and exercise regularly to calm your mind. Keep your environment clean and away from health-hazardous substances like soot and pollution. A well-balanced diet paired with a healthy routine can avert premature graying of hair. Start early on as the earlier it&#8217;s tackled, the better. Also, maintain a good hair care routine that suits best.</p>\n",

Coronavirus affects the lungs primarily and several organs consequently hence it\u2019s important to focus on building lung capacity and perform exercises specifically focusing on it. Exercises targeted at building lung capacity will reduce the risk of severity and enhance energy and flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Celebrity fitness trainer <strong>Yasmin Karachiwala</strong> who is known to shape several B-town celebrities like Katrina Kaif, BipashaBasu, DeepikaPadukone to name a few, shared on her feed about post-Covid workout routine. The trainer recovered from the disease and swears by this routine after recovery. Recovery and post-Covid strategies are as important as prevention strategies of the virus. Weakness and fatigue are common amongst covid recovered individuals and special care must be taken to avoid future complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Points to take care of:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Start your regime slowly and not at once</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Limit your exposure to too much information and contradiction of facts</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Look for any post-Covid complications that must be addressed</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Key to recovery is to regain strength and building up the lost energy</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with a video of exercises that can be done at home, the trainer wrote, \u201c<em>Waiting to get back to your exercise routine after Covid? I would like to share with you some of the exercises that I did when I recovered, which really helped me increase my <strong>lung capacity</strong> and make my body less stiff! Do note that my&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.nmamilife.com/now-trending/the-second-wave-of-covid-19-and-children-know-the-precautions-and-symptoms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">symptoms</a><em>&nbsp;were mild. If your symptoms are not mild or you are yet to fully recover, please consult your physician/doctor before doing any of these exercises. I started these exercises very slowly with <strong>lowintensity</strong> doing only as many reps as my body felt comfortable doing. I was also constantly listening to my body, which is the most important thing any of us can do Post Covid.\u201d</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The list of exercises that would help to build lung capacity include:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Abdominal Breathing Diaphragmatic</li><li>Lateral Lung Breathing</li><li>Side Bend \u2013 Single Lung Breathing</li><li>Cat &amp; Cow \u2013 Spine Mobilization</li><li>Twist &amp; Hold (Spinal Rotation with Breath)<a></a></li><li>Mini Swan \u2013 Thoracic Extension</li><li>Hip Flexor Stretch (Releasing tightness due to sitting all day)</li><li>Butterfly Stretch \u2013 Stretch Hips, Glutes, Groin &amp; Inner Thigh)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to address the fact that heavy medications and complications are bound to make an individual weak. Proper guidance can help in speedy recovery correctly. Follow the guidance of the trainer and slowly incorporate them into your routine. Make sure to consult your doctor or medical personnel in case of complications.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Turmeric, \u201cThe Golden Spice\u201d which is native to India has found its way to the rest of the world because of its extremely beneficial properties ranging from anti-bacterial to anti-cancer effects. It has been in existence for ages and found its reference in Ayurveda for its medicinal and nutritive properties. Indian Cuisine, especially Indian curries are just incomplete with this essential spice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bright yellow color of turmeric is due to the presence of an extremely important pigment which is also an anti-oxidant, called&nbsp;<strong>Curcumin</strong>. It has several medicinal and health benefits such as anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer effects to name a few. A concoction of turmeric is almost a must during any cough and cold. It boosts immunity and is often a great combination with milk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anti-Cancer Effects of Turmeric</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Studies carried out at the National Institute of Nutrition suggest that turmeric has anti-cancer properties</li><li>Tumerin isolated from turmeric is a potent antioxidant and anticarcinogen</li><li>It is reported to reduce cholesterol and severe irritation in the stomach</li><li>It has the potential to convert and detoxify harmful drugs to metabolites that could be excreted.</li><li>Curcumin has potent inhibitory effects on breast cancer, which is the most common type of cancer amongst women.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Incorporate Turmeric every day</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>HaldiDoodh or Turmeric Latte</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently turmeric latte has been a household recipe to boost immunity. Do have raw turmeric crushed or dried ones powdered and mix a teaspoon with a glass of milk before bedtime. Add a pinch of pepper for added benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Turmeric ginger tea</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replace caffeine-rich drinks with a Decoction of turmeric ginger tea. Add few fresh leaves of Tulsi or holy basil for an aromatic and health-beneficial effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.<strong> Curries</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pinch of turmeric powder goes almost in all Indian dishes, especially curries, meat preparation, fries, and fritters. Make sure you add it along with the rest of your spices but don\u2019t overdo it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Seasoning</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turmeric can be seasoned with any vegetables during stir-frying. Toss it along with your favorite spices. You can add it during tempering too. Add it to lentils during boiling with little salt and oil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>Bite it</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can simply take a bite of raw turmeric every day but make sure it\u2019s a small tiny piece. Overconsumption will lead to toxicity. It is best to have turmeric freshly ground to avoid adulteration. Raw or dried turmeric roots are available in the market in abundance so make sure to grab some during your next grocery shopping. Include this magical spice every day in little amounts for long-term benefits from various illnesses and to avail of its anti-cancer benefits.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>A healthy lifestyle is intertwined with a healthy diet. Diet can be used to treat and maintain health and avoid complications like obesity, heart diseases, liver, and digestive issues, to name a few. Likewise, diet plays an important role in pregnancy and ovulation too. However, healthy eating should be a lifelong process and not one time approach to attain fertility. Women need to take extra care of their health especially during fertility to bear a healthy child and also remain healthy themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several issues and complications may emerge with a lack of proper knowledge of diet and practices. Some practices if followed can help maintain fertility via ovulation and proper hormonal balance. Although, there isn\u2019t any magic formula to improve fertility and help to get pregnant, taking care of certain things can help in conceiving along with maintaining a healthy life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Check your water consumption</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consume adequate water and include loads of hydrating drinks like juices, buttermilk, coconut water, etc. Limit the consumption of alcohol, carbonated beverages, tea, and coffee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Cut down on sugar and trans fats</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop the consumption of heavily processed foods loaded with sugar and trans fats as they affect several bodily processes, ovulation being one. They also impact the hormones and creates a misbalance. Avoid consuming carbonated beverages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Look for healthier options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switch junk fried foods with boiled, stewed, or baked items. Include lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Include colorful vegetables and fruits which are rich in phytonutrients. Foods rich in antioxidants and vitamin E, Vitamin A, needs to be added too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Include Folate</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folate is an essential nutrient for maintaining reproductive health and decreases the incidents of fetal abnormalities. Folate plays a key role in fertility so make sure to include lots of greens and seeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Have iron-rich foods</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iron is essential in several bodily processes and helps in lowering the risks of infertility. Make sure to include loads of iron-rich foods in form of green leafy vegetables, black sesame seeds, dates, and eggs. Include loads of vegetables and fruits in your diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Exercise and maintain a healthy weight</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining a healthy weight is very essential for the healthy functioning of all systems of the body. It is vital in regulating periods and maintaining reproductive health. Make sure to engage in various activities and exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight. Change in lifestyle and adoption of unhealthy habits has resulted in increasing infertility amongst people. It is something that will require maintaining a long-term health goal. In some cases, medical intervention may be required but maintaining a balanced and healthy life while focusing on key areas is crucial.</p>\n",

All of it is bound to make readers confused. Having healthy periods is a reflection of a healthy overal<a></a>l system too, as many underlying conditions affect menstrual cycles too. It is thus, important to know what is normal during periods and what isn\u2019t and requires attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;What\u2019s normal during periods?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Regular periods</strong>&#8211; A normal menstrual cycle is of 28 days but it can vary from woman to woman. Often due to environmental changes of routine or stress can lead to delay or early occurrence by 2-3 days. Your menstrual cycle is typically considered in a healthy range if periods occur every 25 to 35. What is important is the consistency of periods every month within the healthy cycle range.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>PMS</strong>&#8211; Pre-menstrual symptoms or PMS occur due to hormonal changes which can be manifested in terms of increased food cravings, breast tenderness, mood swings, acne on the skin, and headaches to name a few.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cramps</strong>&#8211; Period cramps are common amongst a lot of women before and during the periods. Cramps typically occur in muscles of the legs, thighs, arms, and stomach. There is increased discomfort due to the contraction of the uterus and the shredding of linings. Light exercise and drinking adequate fluids can help ease the discomfort and cramps. Leading a healthy lifestyle can largely ease-out pains during periods.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Clotting</strong>&#8211; Blood clotting is during periods is normal and nothing to worry about. About a quarter size of the blood clot is very common during periods and is not harmful. Along with clots, there are discharges too. However, some people experience hemorrhages, or larger clots on a regular basis which may result from complications, and is best to consult a doctor immediately.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s not normal during periods?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Irregular periods</strong>&#8211; periods may get delayed or occur earlier by a day or two which is okay but if periods occur at irregular intervals consistently it is an unhealthy sign. There may be several underlying complications like PCOS, hormonal disturbances, uterus cancer, or pelvic inflammatory diseases. Periods however get irregular during pregnancy or while nearing menopause, which is completely normal.</li><li><strong>Consistent heavy bleeding</strong>&#8211; heavy bleeding on few days of periods occasionally is okay but is a matter of concern if the heavy bleeding occurs on a regular basis during periods. Abnormal hefty bleeding during periods called menorrhagia needs to be checked timely.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Longer bleeding durations</strong>&#8211; bleeding during periods lasts for 3-5 days which is normal but occasional disruptions might be there. However, there may be longer bleeding more than seven days which is a matter of concern and it is better to consult a doctor.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many myths and misconceptions surrounding periods since ages and it is best to seek medical and scientific advice regarding any irregularities. Maintain a balanced, healthy lifestyle for a healthy menstrual cycle.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Often Breast Cancer can be avoidable with early detection and timely treatment. Lack of awareness is prominent amongst the masses who don&#8217;t know what self-breast examination is or how to perform it. Breast self-examination is the regular examination of breasts on your own to detect breast cancer early on. It increases the chance of successful treatment because of early detection. Coupled with screening methods, this self-examination of breasts can be highly effective. We provide you step by step guide for an effective self-examination:<a></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there a difference between the breasts?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start observing your breasts carefully in a resting position in front of a straight mirror either while sitting or standing position. Examine each breast for any visible lumps or unusual features between the two breasts. Observe for any redness, indentations in the breast tissue, or any other changes in the nipples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Observe with your hands on different postures</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes in resting position lumps may not be visible. Observe the peculiarities mentioned in Step 1 but this time with hands pressed on the buttocks with elbows facing forward. This position may bring out lumps that would not have been otherwise visible. Slowly move your elbow side to side keeping your hand on the buttocks and observe anomalies in different angles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Observe any dimpling or puckering of the skin by lifting the hand and keeping it straight up above your head. When you raise your arm, the lump if present rests and pulls your skin inwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examining with first three fingers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This examination involves feeling your breasts. The examination needs to be carried out while laying down. For this rest your head up on a pillow and place your arm behind it. Use the first three fingers of the right arm to examine the left breast and vice versa. Take three fingers, i.e. index, middle, and ring fingers, and press down the breast gently and the area around it. This will help in distinguishing lumps from normal breast tissue. Increase pressure gently to examine better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Feel the area around your breasts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with examining breasts, it is important to check the area around the breasts too. Use circular motions and increasing pressure starting from the collarbone to underneath the breasts. The feel will be different like swelling of lymph nodes, a size of a pea or walnut. In such cases immediately visit your gynecologist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Regularly test every month</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to carry out a routine examination of your breasts every month around the same time. Try to avoid the menstruating cycle as there are menstrual-related breast changes like swelling happening during periods. Menopausal women can try examining any time of the month but at regular intervals. Initially, it may seem confusing and difficult to examine your breasts, but once you garner the tactic it is easier than you think. Take time for yourself every month and examine your breasts for a better future, as the saying goes, prevention is better than Cure!</p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "\n<p>People across all age groups are facing trouble sleeping, more so in the recent pandemic situation. With lifestyle-induced stress and anxiety on the rise, many are now devoid of quality sleep. However, a good night\u2019s sleep both in quantity as well as quality is essential for the proper functioning of the body as well as mind and dealing with tough situations better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diet and nutrition play an important role in our sleep cycle along with the environment, exercise, and daily routine. Foods containing melatonin along with certain other nutrients regulates our internal clock and signals the body to prepare for a sound sleep. Let us look at 5 foods that can promote better sleep:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Warm milk</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably as old as a tale, our grandmothers have been telling us how a cup of warm milk before bedtime promotes better sleep. This is because milk contains an amino acid tryptophan which helps to make sleep-regulating melatonin and serotonin. They also regulate mood, appetite along sleep. Warm milk when taken together with turmeric as \u201cHaldi Doodh\u201d or with cinnamon, Almonds as \u201cBadam milk\u201d, its benefits are increased manifold. This is something that can be consumed across age groups, from kids to the elderly, for better sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Fatty Fish</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fatty fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, specifically EPA and DHA. They are known to reduce inflammation and promote brain health. Fatty fish is also rich in Vitamin D. Combination of both helps inducing better sleep as they have shown to increase serotonin levels. Include fatty fish at your dinner for a restful sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Nuts: Walnuts and Almonds</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loaded with omega 3 fatty acids, magnesium, folate, and calcium, they aid in boosting melatonin and serotonin levels and help regulate sleep and mood. They are also vital to maintain heart health and supply essential nutrients. Include a few almonds or walnuts before bedtime, preferably with a glass of milk for beneficial effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Kiwi</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know how kiwis are a great source of Vitamin C which maintains our health and immunity, but they are also a powerhouse of nutrients like folate, Vitamin K, potassium, and are low in calories. According to several studies, kiwis have the potential to improve sleep quality because of serotonin in it which regulates the sleep cycle. &nbsp;Eating few pieces of kiwi fruit can be your option to have a sound sleep at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Chamomile Tea</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The calming effect of chamomile tea is nothing new to tea lovers. This herbal tea is loaded with antioxidants and is best known to relieve stress and induce peaceful sleep. There is evidence that suggests that drinking chamomile tea reduces anxiety and depression, improves skin health, and strengthens the immune system while also improving better sleep. It contains an antioxidant that binds to certain receptors in the brain that promote sleepiness. Drinking a cup of warm chamomile tea before bedtime is not only soothing but also light on the stomach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above-mentioned foods will work best in promoting better sleep if they are coupled with a better healthy lifestyle, moderate exercise, and proper work and sleep cycle along with limiting blue light emitted from screens before bedtime. A proper sleep cycle with quality sleep goes a long way in improving health and avoiding health complications, and these foods will certainly help in achieving that.</p>\n",

All of it is because of the vast micro biome that resides there. Two of the most important factors that influence the intestinal integrity are the bacterial population in the gut and the health of the gut mucosa, both of which are influenced by several factors and lifestyle plays an important role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining healthy gut flora is very important to life a long, healthy life, imbalance of which can lead to cancer whereas on the other hand a healthy lifestyle promotes healthy gut flora thereby adverting several life threatening health conditions like cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years there is explorative studies on the role of diet and other environmental factors in affecting the composition and metabolic activity of the human gut microbiota which in turn affects health. Let\u2019s look how our actions affect negatively and positively:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lifestyle that affects gut bacteria negatively</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Addictive habits: </strong>regular habits of smoking, drinking has been associated with imbalance in gut population which in turn lead to bio activation of enzymes in the gut bacteria. These bio activations can lead to cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Unhealthy eating habits</strong>&#8211; consuming junk, heavily fried items, additives and colours, frequently eating out, lack of fiber deprives gut bacteria of required nutrients for them to flourish and creates imbalance in population. It is in turn manifested with several digestive issues and health hazards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Sedentary lifestyle:</strong>&nbsp;Lack of physical activity and exercise lead to unhealthy cravings, release of excessive hormones, depression all of which affects the gut micro biome and dwindling its population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Ignoring early years</strong>&#8211; Inadequate breastfeeding and improper food habits in the early, formative years leads to poor gut bacteria population formation and if impacts lifelong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>Heavy drugs and environment-</strong>&nbsp;Consuming heavy antibiotics kills the bacterial population good or bad and inadequate replenishment of good bacteria affects health overall. Polluted environment and surrounding lead to formation of carcinogenic compounds which affect the gut health majorly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-custom-weight\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><strong>Lifestyle that affects gut bacteria positively</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Nutrition</strong>&#8211; Regular inclusion of prebiotics and probiotics in diet leads to healthy gut and proliferation of good bacteria which affect overall health positively. Diet rich in prebiotics like fiber and peels of fruits, legumes are as important as consuming probiotics like curd, buttermilk etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Regular Activity</strong>&#8211; Active lifestyle releases good hormones and helps in the healthy gut bacteria formation. Regular exercises in turn lead to healthy digestive system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Explorative lifestyle</strong>&#8211; Experiencing diverse range of foods and cuisines is very important for a healthy colon bacteria. Make sure to include different fruits, vegetables and food ingredients and not stick to monotonous routine. Eating seasonal foods are very important too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4<strong>. Healthy environment and surroundings</strong>&#8211; Having a positive, unpolluted surrounding is very important for both mind and body. Fresh air, water and basic necessities are very important that leads to healthy gut bacteria and thus a healthy life. They also reduces the risk of cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>Routine</strong>&#8211; a proper everyday routine of sleep cycle, food, stool timings and activities leads to proper maintaining of biological clock, digestive system, and overall outlook of life. It helps functioning of gut bacteria better, thereby releasing ample enzymes and absorption of nutrients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, it is an endless loop, the way we lead our everyday life affects our gut bacteria and thereby affecting our immunity and several bodily processes whereby leading to a prolonged, healthy life.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Right from tempering of your favorite dal in your lunch to those tempting fries, it is hard to imagine life without oil, isn\u2019t it? As we move towards healthy lifestyles, diet trends push it to the extremes of elimination of certain ingredients. But is oil-free diet justifiable?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oil which is a category of fat, provides 9kcal per gram, which is the highest of the macronutrients. This readily available energy can be a blessing as well a curse if its intake is not properly regulated. Many weight watchers tend to eliminate oil completely from diet and resort to options like air fried chips, steamed curries, boiled vegetables, baked goods etc. Modern equipment and utensils like non-stick pans too aid in preparation of food without the use of oil. But in the process, don\u2019t we forget the very essence of food that it should be enjoyable and fulfilling too? This is where proper guidance and necessary knowledge is important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn when to say no!</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The food industry is booming with unhealthy, heavily fried junks that tempts us to \u201ccheat\u201d our diet. A pack of deep fried chips at a store or pakoras and fritters at a local street stall is more readily available than healthier alternatives. Refined saturated oils and oils that has been repeatedly used for frying (as in roadside stalls) are extremely harmful to our system. This leads to series of health conditions like affecting heart health, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol to name a few. Such unhealthy junks affect digestive and mental health too. Though they may seem extremely tempting, we should know when to say no!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Everything about oils aren\u2019t bad!</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oils are extremely important for proper functioning of our systems too! From <strong>absorbing the fat-soluble vitamins</strong>&nbsp;to <strong>transmitting neurological signals</strong>, they are very important, apart from being an energy source, <strong>palatable</strong>&nbsp;and enjoying the process of eating. Oils are also important to maintain <strong>healthy skin</strong>. Understanding the right method of usage, quantity, cooking temperature of oils are extremely important to avail maximum benefits from oil. Fat based diet are prescribed specifically for several neurological issues like Alzheimer\u2019s too. There are several types of oils that benefit our systems. Following are to name a few:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Rice bran oil</strong>&#8211; Rice bran oil is extremely healthy oil, rich in micronutrients and containing tocopherol which is vitamin E fat soluble vitamin. It is beneficial for maintaining healthy heart, lowering cholesterol, building immunity, protecting cells from oxidative damage.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Coconut oil</strong>&#8211; It contains MCTs or medium chain fatty acids which are helpful in increasing the levels of HDL cholesterol which is a good cholesterol helping in lowering the bad ones. Coconut oil is extremely helpful in digestive issues when absorption is compromised.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Olive oil</strong>&#8211; Olive oil is anti-inflammatory and contains good amount of MUFA which is good for heart and overall health. It is mostly used as salad dressing, light saut\u00e9ing and tempering. It is not meant for deep frying.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cold pressed oils</strong>&#8211; Cold pressed oils retain the nutritive benefits and are not lost in processing of extraction. They are of superior health benefits.</li><li><strong>Nut oils</strong>&#8211; oils extracted from nuts and seeds like almond, sesame are rich in nutrients and phytochemicals which have added health benefits.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Oils can be both harmful and beneficial depending on source, usage and quantity. It is advisable to consult dietitian before eliminating oil from diet following trends. Depending on body conditions, lifestyle, health goals and underlying requirements, professionals can guide properly on combination of oils, quantity and its usage and planning.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p class=\"mb-0 pb-0 mt-0 pt-0\">A novel corona virus that originated in 2019 as Covid-19 has undergone several mutations ever since. One of the Covid-19 variants- B.1.617.2 or the Delta variant of Covid which was first identified in India is becoming a dominant variant of disease globally, according to World Health Organization (WHO).</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"mb-0 pb-0 mt-0 pt-0\">What makes the delta variant a matter of concern is that it is highly contagious and spreads rapidly amongst the younger population. A recent study from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention showed the viral load of the delta variant being 1000 times higher than the initial strain of covid. While it is not clear whether it makes people sicker, but experts suggest it is by far the most rapidly spreading of all variants. Vaccinated people are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms if they contract the Covid delta variant. Most of the hospitalized cases across the globe were of an unvaccinated population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"mb-0 pb-0 mt-0 pt-0\">While the delta variant can affect any age group, it has been found to affect the younger population more. One study suggests that this could be due to the fact that most of the older population had already been vaccinated and were of low social contacts as compared to the younger generation who are more susceptible due to low vaccination rates and higher social and occupation contacts. However, vaccinated individuals can spread the delta variant rapidly to others without themselves being seriously ill. Hence, experts suggest the necessity of wearing masks and maintaining safety protocols even with a vaccinated population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"mb-0 pb-0 mt-0 pt-0\"><br><strong>How to protect the younger population?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"mb-0 pb-0 mt-0 pt-0\">Since the research to vaccinate younger population below 18 is still underway in India specifically at The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi and Serum Institute of India (SII) Pune, and might take up to December 2021, provisions to import vaccines are underway.<br>The eligible population for vaccination in India, 18 and above must get vaccinated to prevent further outbreaks and protect the younger generation. The vaccine is effective in preventing illness, hospitalization, and death. Since vaccinated individuals can still be carriers of the variant as it spreads rapidly even in the vaccinated population without causing many symptoms, hence safety protocols must be followed at all times.<br>American Academy of Pediatrics reported below 18 children, older teens and adults need to be cautious. They need to limit unnecessary exposure and avoid high-risk zones. With schools, colleges, and institutions closed, the young population has to focus on building physical and mental health. Resorting to an unhealthy, sedentary lifestyle will only result in weakness and poorer immunity. Including fresh fruits and vegetables, everyday physical activity, engaging in other curricular activities, and limiting screen time are vital steps too.<br>Previous outbreaks saw populations with underlying conditions being more affected, but present variants depend more on the vaccination status of individuals. The Delta variant falls under the Variant of Concern according to Prathit A. Kulkarni, infectious disease specialist at Baylor St. Lukes Medical Center, Texas, USA. The delta variant being an area of concern and much of it is still in research, protocols should be underway to prevent a third wave of outbreak. The virus will continue to mutate as unvaccinated people contract the virus, hence safety should be everyone\u2019s priority until the entire population is fully vaccinated.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Gluten sensitivity and celiac disease caused due to the presence of a protein component called gluten has affected many individuals, disrupting their digestive system. Many without any known or diagnosed gluten sensitivity are shifting to a gluten-free diet in recent times too. Many adults get diagnosed with gluten intolerance or sensitivity much later in life. Since gluten is present in staple food grains as wheat, rye, barley, it\u2019s important to look for alternative grains and avoid food and food products with gluten in it. Such individuals find it tough as they can\u2019t enjoy simple and widely available products like bread, biscuits, cakes, chapatti, pasta, etc. Here is a list of healthy food grains and seeds that are completely gluten-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Quinoa</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quinoa is a super grain which is also called \u201cthe mother grain\u201d for its superior nutrient quality. It is rich in complex carbs, fiber, amino acids like lysine, cysteine, methionine and is an excellent source of iron and phosphorus. Replace your wheat and rice with quinoa in form of staple, salad, mixing with veggies and condiments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Chia</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chia is a super seed loaded with good fats in form of omega 3 fatty acids, fiber, and antioxidants. It is a vegan substitute for eggs in baking too! Incorporate it in your diet as pudding, in baking, or sprinkle on your breakfast bowl and beverages!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Oats</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oats is a good staple grain rich in beta-glucans known to reduce cholesterol levels. It is high in fiber, bringing in satiety for longer durations and also aid in losing weight by controlling portion size. One can choose whole oat groats, steel-cut oats, rolled oats, or instant oats. \u00a0Rich in zinc, iron, antioxidants, phosphorus, oats is a great breakfast or meal option with a variety of toppings like seeds, nuts, fruits, nut butter, etc. to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Amaranth</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amaranth comes under the category of cereals as well as minor seeds. They are very unique as all the nutrients are concentrated on its center and as a result, it\u2019s protected during processing. It is a good source of protein, iron, magnesium, manganese, and phosphorus. Amaranth puffs, chikki, bars can be consumed as snacks or breakfast, replacing gluten-based snacks like cakes and cookies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Buckwheat</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it has wheat in its name, it\u2019s not related to wheat. Make cakes, muffins, dhokla, bread, or anything with buckwheat flour. Sprouted buckwheat is also a great way to include good quality nutrients like manganese and amino acids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although these grains are gluten-free by nature, one must be extra careful while purchasing them and look into labels carefully as the cross-contamination with gluten-based products happens during processing. One must also incorporate good sources of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds in the diet.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Trying hard starving and dieting to fit into your favorite outfit for the big day and then gaining extra kilos soon after the wedding is over? Well, you aren\u2019t alone in this! Most people prepare months to stay fit and look best at their wedding but celebrations such as Indian weddings are mostly a grand feast. Followed by that there is pampering from in-laws, lack of activity, more outing, and being less mindful of one\u2019s diet. All these results in weight gain post-wedding. A different shift in routine and life may take a toll on one\u2019s health too. Hormonal changes occur too. Following are some tips to bring you back on track to a healthy weight!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Motivate to exercise together</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Embarking on a new journey can be challenging but staying fit gets easier when there is some push in form of mutual motivation to stay fit. If one gets lazy, munching on chips while watching TV, the other gets demotivated too. Working out can actually be fun. It would be a great way to bond, have a conversation as well as level up your motivation. You can either go for a morning run together or train at a gym together or even exercise and yoga at home together and pump up your energy levels!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Limit outside eating</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The festive mood tends to indulge in outside food. More often portion control isn\u2019t done and overeating causes a series of health issues. Try to eat at home as much as possible maintaining a balanced routine. Cooking together is a great way to spend time with a partner too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Be mindful while travelling</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post-wedding comes the exciting part of traveling, honeymoons, and exploring. Most often couples are less mindful and indulge in heavy eating and experimenting. While it\u2019s okay to indulge and enjoy food but one must be mindful about overeating calorie-dense foods and unhealthy junk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Get enough sleep</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often lack of sleep due to added workload post-wedding or lifestyle changes take a toll on health. Make sure you have enough sleep at a proper routine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Carry healthy snacks</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrying healthy snacks like nuts, seed mix, multigrain granola, etc. while traveling or working is a great way to control junk food consumption which results in weight gain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a proper, active, and healthy lifestyle post-wedding can help you avoid unnecessary weight gain and prevent various lifestyle disorders and diseases.</p>\n",

It is low in fiber and nutrients.</p>\n<p><strong>Cooking time</strong></p>\n<p>White rice is refined and polished with no bran layer cooks faster than brown rice. Brown rice takes a longer time to cook since it has a fiber-rich coarse bran layer. The roughly cooking time of brown rice is 40-50 minutes but it is worth the time!</p>\n<p><strong>Satiety</strong></p>\n<p>Brown rice makes you full quicker hence you need to consume a lesser quantity to reach satiety whereas white rice, rich in starch, reaches fullness much later. Hence you end up eating more white rice!</p>\n<p><strong>Health Effects</strong></p>\n<p>The fiber-rich brown rice helps in lowering cholesterol, eases the digestive process, and reaches satiety faster. It controls overeating and prevents the onset of diabetes and heart diseases. It also aids in weight loss and an active lifestyle.</p>\n<h4><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3315 size-full\" src=\"https://azra.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/single-post-img.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"418\" /></h4>\n",

It might seem demotivating and unfulfilling after religiously following so hard and reaching a point where you feel you can\u2019t push more ahead, but it is important to understand that it is part of the process and it\u2019s extremely normal. With some right kind of alterations and guidance, you can again be on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why does it happen?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the body has adjusted to a low-calorie diet, it usually results in a stall where body stops dropping kilos. Since the body is extremely adaptable, it requires far lesser calorie than before. One can however come out of this stagnation and here is how:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Principle of progressive overload</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a continuous process to improve the endurance, muscle strength, and size. For an instance, on doing 20 reps of 2 sets of push-ups every day for a certain period of time, there would be shaping of chest and biceps. But there would come a point wherein they won\u2019t grow any further. This is when alternation is needed instead of giving up. Either modify your sets and reps or include more weight to the regimen. This will then lead to a better build and overcoming the weight loss plateau.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enough Sleep</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep is the key to good health be it mental, physical, or emotional. Proper workout and diet should be accompanied by a good and sound sleep to metabolize properly. Improper sleep may result in stalled weight, altering hormones and driving up fat storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Re-analyze diet</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A balance of all food groups and nutrients is essential. When weight stalling occur you may think of re-analyzing your diet and incorporate alternate sources of the food group. Following monotonous diet will do body more harm than good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Avoid Alcohol and limit eating out</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alcohol tends to loose inhibitions and make you indulge in wrong food choices. Limit eating empty calories and junk food. It alters metabolism in a bad way. While eating out prefer healthier alternatives which are more suited to your regimen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Activities outside gym</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from gym routine, one must also indulge in various outdoor games like squash, football, badminton, running, free-hand stretches, dancing, etc. This will bring in a routine change, reduce stress, and help in working on entire body in varied manner. Such activities help in improving mental composure and beats anxiety.</p>\n",

Generally, 6-8 weeks of rest should be given post-delivery. Weight loss journey post pregnancy should be gradual and best when backed by professional guidance. Here is a list of exercises for a safe workout journey post-delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Walking</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Light, brisk walk not only aid in better metabolism but also improves mood and wellbeing. Prefer walking in a park or beach where you can tune in to nature and get much-needed fresh air too! Carry your baby in a perambulator and don\u2019t miss out on walking every day!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Yoga</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no better substitute of Yoga. It not only corrects posture and balance but also instils positive energy within. Many new mothers have disturbed and irritable moods which can be effectively dealt with proper yoga. Begin with easy postures to bring back the body flexibility and then continue with specialized positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Pilates</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pilates helps in working on the core and flexibility. It helps in toning and strengthening the muscles. It also helps in reducing stress and aid in fat burning. It is gentle to the body and helps in easing tense muscles.

Light weight training</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mothers should not at once start exercising with heavy equipment. Exercise for new mothers should start with light, free hand training followed by difficult and more intense ones. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Cycling</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although mothers who experience bleeding should not try cycling at once, but after bodily changes are reverting to normal light cycling is beneficial. After few weeks rest post-delivery, one should gradually start cycling. It helps in managing weight, strengthens muscles, relaxes mind and allows some personal time to engage in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many mothers start working out in heavy equipment without proper knowledge. One must start exercising slowly focusing on parts that needs more attention. Since every body type is unique, care and exercise should also involve personalization with proper consultation and guidance from professionals.</p>\n",

Exercise and ageing is so tightly interlinked that without exercise you age faster, be subjected to tons of ailments and diseases, and lose out on health benefits that would have been possible with proper exercise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercise is for all age groups. One may start slowly and gradually pick up pace. Once a person realizes how beneficial exercise is, it will help in bringing positivity and longevity to one\u2019s life. Exercise plays an important role in delaying ageing and extending youthful and healthy life. Here\u2019s how!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. It strengthens and tones muscles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercise helps in strengthening body and muscles and helps you in performing heavy works. People with no exercise barely can do any heavy work and get tired easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Prevents osteoporosis</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercise improves bone health and makes them stronger. Women who don\u2019t exercise tend to have fragile bones and onset of osteoporosis happens earlier whereas women who exercise everyday delays osteoporosis from happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Maintains skin health</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skin elasticity and tonicity is maintained by regular exercise. It also makes the skin glow. It helps in preventing wrinkles and skin from sagging. More than superficial cosmetics, good diet and exercise reflects in skin greatly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Prevents age related health conditions</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engaging in regular exercise of 1 hour ranging from running, walking, freehand exercise or yoga has shown to improve health conditions and also prevent lifestyle disorders like diabetes, obesity, CVD, etc. Elderly population who exercises have far less health conditions than the ones living a sedentary life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Improves longevity</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who exercise regularly live longer and healthier. In Japan, people exercise, eat a proper healthy diet, abstain from junk food and they have one of the longest living population. Exercise makes later years of life bearable and beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies have shown that individuals who have been exercising all their life age far slower than individuals of same age who live a sedentary lifestyle. They also tend to live more, are less affected with health complications, and have a positive approach towards life.</p>\n",

While the bride and groom embark on the new journey, most often they end up gaining weight after the wedding and there is a remarkable shift from singlehood to wedlock! As important it was to be the best and fit version of yourself on your big day, it is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle throughout post-wedding to have an active and healthy life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The celebrations don\u2019t generally stop at weddings and continue for weeks with new relatives making you indulge in those gorgeous desserts to in- laws making you eat more. A different shift in routine and life may take a toll on one\u2019s health too. Hormonal changes occur too. Hence proper care should be given to one\u2019s diet and lifestyle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Careless indulgence needs to be monitored and sticking to a healthier routine should be a priority. Here is a list of ways how you can tackle the post-wedding weight gain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Mindful indulgence</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weddings bring forth social gatherings, outings, and events. Be careful what you indulge in and don\u2019t succumb to peer pressure. Don\u2019t indulge in too much junk and take care of the portion size. Avoid over indulgence in sweets and desserts as there is a tendency that most relatives and people visiting would bring a pack of sweets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Be active</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indulge an inactive lifestyle and stay fit by practicing yoga, aerobic exercise, and house-hold chores, go for a run, exercise, etc. Get your partner involved too and practice living an active lifestyle. It not only helps in staying fit but also prevents health disorders and complications like diabetes, cancer, obesity, and heart diseases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Portion size</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be careful of how much you eat as much as what you eat. Often there is a tendency to finish off food and leftovers to avoid waste. Be mindful of how much you cook so that both overeating and wastage are avoided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Initiate healthy habits</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new member can help in inculcating healthy habits and behavioral changes in a family as a whole. It will help in eradicating unhealthy habits and encourage towards a healthy living. While cooking, look for healthier options over-refined and empty calories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Buy smart</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indulge in healthy shopping and buy smartly. Look for healthier ingredients and commit to healthy grocery shopping for you and family as a whole.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "\n<p>Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder preventing the utilization of glucose partially or completely. Predominantly there are two types-type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes depend on insulin which occurs mostly because of the inability of the pancreas to produce enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes on the other hand is non-insulin dependent diabetes. Enough insulin is produced but its action is impaired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timely detection of diabetes and proper management can help to control it to a great extent. Here are some points that help in preventing and controlling diabetes:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Healthy Diet</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The diet recommended for a diabetes patient should be high in fiber, low in refined carbohydrates. Cutting down on empty calories, sugary items, colas, heavily processed foods, junk foods is very important. Refined carbs like maida, cakes, pastries, etc. should be completely avoided. One must also look into the glycemic index of foods and consume foods with a low glycemic load. Foods which rapidly increases blood glucose levels should be avoided since it would put a strain on the pancreas to release insulin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Exercise Regularly</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular activity and exercise can help prevent diabetes by not only managing body weight but also increasing the insulin sensitivity of the body cells. \u00a0It helps in consuming more energy and keeping the blood glucose in the lower range. One must engage in aerobic exercises, walking, cycling, bicycling, swimming, yoga on a regular basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Check what you drink</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinks like colas, fruit juices, sodas are loaded with sugars and calories that rapidly spike blood glucose levels. Instead, try having plain water and have it as often as possible. Packaged drinks and beverages are loaded with hidden sugars and additives which adversely affect the condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. &nbsp;Healthy weight</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who are overweight and obese are more predisposed to having diabetes and other lifestyle disorders. Mostly the fat is accumulated in the midsection and lower abdomen which may lead to insulin resistance. Managing weight is thus very essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Give up smoking</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smokers are highly at risk in developing diabetes, more so if he or she is pre-diabetic. Passive smoking also increases the risk. Quitting smoking will help to bring down the risk factor in developing diabetes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Avoid sedentary life</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies have shown a significant link between a sedentary lifestyle and type 2 diabetes. Avoid living a sedentary life and engage in activities like household chores, freehand exercise, brisk walking, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Optimize Vitamin D levels</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitamin D is believed to improve the body\u2019s sensitivity to insulin and thus reduce insulin resistance. Have adequate sources of vitamin D, fortified foods along with a daily dose of sunshine!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complications associated with diabetes are elaborate, hence strict routine and management are advised.</p>\n",

But in the case of PCOS, acne is almost inevitable. Acne outbreak may affect your mental health as well but the temporary and superficial application of products won\u2019t provide you the cure to the root problem that lies within!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0Acne is one of the most common signs of PCOS and often people mistake it to be a a result of puberty even past teen years. Acne can be severly painful and may get an ugly infection if not managed well. As much as 25% women have shown to seek treatment of acne due to PCOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How is PCOS related to acne?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCOS and acne are linked due to the overproduction of the hormone androgen caused due to insulin resistance. Acne serves as one of the symptoms of PCOS.it is mostly difficult to cure PCOS related acne which predominates the lower portion of the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to distinguish PCOS Acne from regular acne?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acne generally occurs when pores get blocked by dead cells, or sebaceous glands produce excess oil under your skin leading to outbreaks which may also harbor bacteria and lead to pus and infections. In the case of PCOS acne is a lot severe with tender skin rather than bumps. It mostly occurs lower face in the cheeks, chin, jawline, and neck. They are very sensitive and may also result like cysts, leaving behind terrible scars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The excess oil production in sebaceous glands occurs due to the imbalance of testosterone which is the male sex hormone and leads to acne along with trapping of oil, bacteria, and dead skin. This imbalance to an extent also occurs during the menstrual cycle leading to blemishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to manage it?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proper dietary habits, reduction of excess weight, cutting down on unhealthy junk and fried foods, and staying hydrated is very essential. Having anti-inflammatory foods and avoiding foods that contribute to inflammation help in easing the condition too. There needs to be proper guidance and dietary management which can help in keeping hormone levels in check.</p>\n",

Well, you need careful planning and understanding on how to make them eat nutritious foods without much fuss!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Slowly bring in the new!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many kids feels reluctant to try new foods and mostly the ones they find \u201cugly\u201d! Try to introduce new foods slowly, along with their favorite dishes. Add fruits like guava with apple, or grapes in a fruit bowl. Mix new veggies in a curry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Make them presentable</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children love attractive platter. Prepare foods in shape of their favorite cartoon characters, animals etc. Decorate toasts with fruits in shape of bears, monkey etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Color they love!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kids find dull colors boring! Make meals colorful with ingredients like beetroot, various fruits to make patterns and visually appealing. Colorful foods contain pigments that are antioxidants and highly beneficial to the body like the anthocyanin, betalin, revesterol etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Add texture</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many kids prefer one texture over other, like they may not eat mashed potato but have it as potato crisps. Add wide variety of texture in meals, make crisps out of vegetables like yam, beetroot, kale etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. &nbsp;Go the alternative way</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your child don\u2019t like having oats porridge, make them into veg oats upma or choco overnight oats, or in form of pancakes. Ingredients can be incorporated into different recipes to make it more attractive and to add variety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Nutrition in disguise</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most kids are picky eaters when it comes to vegetables, milk, or certain fruits. Even after repeated trials to make into different alternatives, they somehow sniff and understand! You may add those foods in disguise like in blended smoothie or batter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Alternative nutrition sources</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although a particular food is irreplaceable, but if your child won\u2019t just consume a food, look for alternative foods with similar nutrient profile like add more citrus fruits for vitamin C if they don\u2019t consume amla or guava. Add sesame seeds in diet for calcium if they consume less milk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Careful planning and understanding your child\u2019s habits goes a long way in making behavioral changes in them and avoid deficiencies. It might get tiring and troublesome but appropriate guidance and patience will help in the long run!</p>\n",

While each body built up is different with different metabolism and routine, there are certain foods that are super helpful in easing out the condition of PCOS and its associated symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from medication, these foods will come handy in improving your condition and help you manage PCOS better. Most of the super foods mentioned are readily available in a home kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Flax seeds</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tiny seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and lignin. They help in reducing testosterone levels and help in improving lipid profile. These seeds are good source of good fats and fiber which help in improving mood swings and reducing androgen level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Turmeric</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turmeric is loaded with medicinal properties and helps ease out inflammation to a great extent. Include it in your recipes or have it raw or add it to your milk as turmeric latte. You can also include it as turmeric tea with ginger in the morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Cinnamon</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cinnamon or dalchini has strong distinct aroma, astringent properties and sweetish distinct taste. It helps in managing PCOS by improving metabolism, aiding weight loss, regulating menstrual cycle among many others. It significantly reduces insulin resistance which is one of the main causes of PCOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Fatty fish</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another superfood for PCOS is fatty fish which is rich in omega 3 fatty acids. It helps in reducing serum testosterone and regulate menstrual cycle effectively. Include indian mackerel, sardines, trout, cod pomfret and herring. It is also rich in vitamin D, protein and B vitamins effective in fighting PCOS</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Barley</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most women suffering from PCOS is also overweight or obese. Low GI food like barley can be of great help in bringing down blood sugar level as it takes time to digest and releases glucose slowly. Among other grains, barley has shown lowest GI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While PCOS can\u2019t be cured but proper exercise and dietary planning is very effective in managing it. Include these above mentioned readily available super foods in your everyday diet and help ease out PCOS!</p>\n",

The key principal is to maintain the proportion of high fat, moderate protein and minimum carbohydrates. The source of these nutrients are very much important as incorrect source may lead to adverse effects on the body!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Fruits</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally fruits are rich in carbohydrates in form of fructose hence correct choice of fruits that are low in carbs and high in nutrients is essential. Include melons like water melons, cantaloupe, muskmelon; Citrus fruits like lemons, pomelo; berries like strawberry, raspberry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Vegetables</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid starchy vegetables like potatoes and include green leafy vegetables rich in fiber like spinach, celery. Include fat rich avocadoes. Cauliflower, cabbage, mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini can be added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Grains</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Include super seeds like amaranth, quinoa instead of rice. Include high fiber grains over refined ones. Avoid rice and wheat and settle for alternatives in form of almond flour or coconut flour instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Nuts and seeds</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ample amount of nuts like almonds, coconut, cashews, and walnuts should be included along with seeds of chia, pumpkin, sunflower, flax rich in omega fatty acids and good fats. While on keto, instead of grain flours, flours made out of almonds, coconut is used for preparing rotis, pizza, bread etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Dairy</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Include full fat yogurt, cream, butter, cheese, paneer in various dishes. Add fruits and high fiber grains to yogurt for better nutrition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Oil</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Include olive oil, MCTs like coconut oil. Avoid too much saturated fats and have unsaturated PUFA, MUFA rich fats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Meat and fish</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good amount of meat can be included including red meat. Fish rich is omega fatty acids should be incorporated. Eggs should be included too for proper amount of protein consumption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All food groups should be present but the key is to have proper choices from the food groups. Our staple being carbohydrate rich foods, shifting to fat based diet may seem difficult but proper guidance can lead to amazing results.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Keto diet has been around quite a long time now.\u00a0 So what is it all about? Well, Keto diet is followed by weight watchers, wanting a quick and easy way to lose weight. This diet basically restricts carbohydrates, basic source of energy to the body, and increases the intake of fats and proteins. Yes! Fats! The energy source shifts from carbs to fats and proteins, where the metabolism of readily available fats and formation of ketones occur and in turn unnecessary conversion of carbs to fats is restricted.</p>\n<p><strong>What about fats?</strong></p>\n<p>Fats provide 9kcal per gram, whereas carb and proteins provide 4kcal per gram. Thus fats are the richest source of energy. But there are good as well as bad fats. Not all kinds of fats are included in a keto diet. Saturated fats which are harmful to the body is avoided and healthy fats like PUFA, MUFA, MCT are added.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>But Carbs are the staple!</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, but apparently not for keto dieters. The carbohydrates, specially refined ones does body more harm than good. The carb is metabolized to release glucose as energy, excess of which gets converted to fats in adipose tissues. All your pasta, rice, chapatti, bread, pizza etc. would be available to you but made out of almond flour, coconut flour or cauliflower (cauliflower pizza base is yum!) or some other substitute! But then carbs can\u2019t be completely removed hence little amount of carbs is included.</p>\n<p><strong>Is keto boring?</strong></p>\n<p>Not at all! It lets you have your favorite dessert without any guilt! Keto diet is mostly interesting with various tasty items like avocadoes, cheese, broccoli, nuts, cauliflower, yogurt, paneer etc.</p>\n<p><strong>What are its benefits?</strong></p>\n<p>Keto diet makes you lose weight faster, all while gulping your favorite pizza or dessert!</p>\n<p>In addition it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>uplifts mood</li>\n<li>slows aging</li>\n<li>better sleep</li>\n<li>increases energy efficiently</li>\n<li>prevents overeating</li>\n<li>reduces inflammation</li>\n<li>gluten friendly</li>\n<li>increases HDL cholesterol which is good for heart</li>\n<li>releases energy steadily</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although initially keto diet may seem tough because of the shift from carbohydrate being staple food, but with proper guidance and diet planning, keto diet can work wonders. Proper diet customized as per body type, activity, preferences is essential for keto diet to work best for you!</p>\n<h4></h4>\n",

Immunity developed in childhood impacts throughout life. With remarkable shift in lifestyle in recent years, new and bad habits can put your child\u2019s immunity at risk if not corrected on time.</p>\n<p>Here are some common habits that might hamper your child\u2019s immunity.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Screen time for prolonged hours\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Kids nowadays are surrounded by multiple digital screens- Smart phones, video games, Television to name a few. This wasn\u2019t the case for previous generations. Screen time although necessary, mustn\u2019t go unchecked. Protracted screen time can be detrimental to your child\u2019s health leading to obesity and affecting eyesight!</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of outdoor activities</strong></p>\n<p>Is your child a couch fanatic? Does he spend most of his time watching or playing video games? If yes, then it\u2019s time for you to encourage them to get off that couch. Low physical activity will weaken your child\u2019s immunity which will make them susceptible to tons of illness. Outdoor time for your child will not only improve their physical strength, build strong muscles and lung capacity but will also boost the dose of Vitamin D in their body. It will also aid in developing hard immunity in them.</p>\n<p><strong>Consumption of junk food</strong></p>\n<p>Many parents tame their kids\u2019 demands by giving them a pack of chips or unhealthy snacks. While it is okay to indulge once in a while but regular consumption of fast food and processed items which are high in sugar, preservatives and additives is detrimental to your child\u2019s health by increasing free radicals in body. It also affects digestion and leads to dreadful inflammation.</p>\n<p><strong>Picky eaters</strong></p>\n<p>This is undeniably every child\u2019s habit. Some may leave the green beans behind, while others may give you a run for avoiding drinking milk. Picky eaters tend to consume fewer fruits and vegetables which can lead to specific nutrient deficiency. As parents, make sure to include 3-4 servings of fruits and veggies and include the disliked food items in different form or recipes to maintain the nutrient balance in body.</p>\n<p>As the saying goes, \u201cOld habits die hard\u201d, let not the bad habits go into adulthood where it gets difficult to change. Parents must identify the prevalent practices of their child to elude intrusion on their immunity. You never know when another deadly virus might erupt!</p>\n<h4></h4>\n",
